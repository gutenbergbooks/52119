<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">I had</span> hoped to be able, in
this Volume, to carry the history of Greece down as far as the battle
of Knidus; but I find myself disappointed.</p>

<p>A greater space than I anticipated has been necessary, not
merely to do justice to the closing events of the Peloponnesian
war, especially the memorable scenes at Athens after the battle of
Arginusæ, but also to explain my views both respecting the Sophists
and respecting Sokratês.</p>

<p>It has been hitherto common to treat the sophists as corruptors
of the Greek mind, and to set forth the fact of such corruption,
increasing as we descend downwards from the great invasion of Xerxês,
as historically certified. Dissenting as I do from former authors,
and believing that Grecian history has been greatly misconceived,
on both these points, I have been forced to discuss the evidences,
and exhibit the reasons for my own way of thinking, at considerable
length.</p>

<p>To Sokratês I have devoted one entire Chapter. No smaller space
would have sufficed to lay before the reader any tolerable picture of
that illustrious man, the rarest intellectual phenomenon of ancient
times, and originator of the most powerful scientific impulse which
the Greek mind ever underwent.</p>

Samos is sustained by the Athenian armament. — The Athenian Parali
— defeat of the oligarchical conspiracy at Samos. — The Paralus
is sent to Athens with the news. — Progress of the oligarchical

— Proceedings of the Four Hundred in the government. — They make
overtures for peace to Agis, and to the Spartans. — They send envoys
to the camp at Samos. — First news of the revolution is conveyed to
the camp by Chæreas — strong sentiment in the camp against the Four
Hundred. — Ardent democratical manifestation, and emphatic oath,
taken both by the Athenian armament at Samos and by the Samians. —
The Athenian democracy is reconstituted by the armament — public
assembly of the soldiers — new generals chosen. — Alkibiadês opens
correspondence with the democratical armament at Samos. — Alkibiadês
comes to Samos, on the invitation of the armament. — Confidence
placed by the armament in his language and promises — they choose
him one of their generals. — New position of Alkibiadês — present
turn of his ambition. — The envoys of the Four Hundred reach Samos
— are indignantly sent back by the armament. — Eagerness of the

Thousand shall be made a reality. — Measures of Antiphon and the

— renewal of the public assembly. — Lacedæmonian fleet threatens

if the Lacedæmonians had acted with energy. — The Four Hundred are
put down — the democracy in substance restored. — Moderation of
political antipathies, and patriotic spirit, now prevalent. — The
Five Thousand — a number never exactly realized — were soon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span> enlarged into universal
citizenship. — Restoration of the complete democracy, all except pay.
— Psephism of Demophantus — democratical oath prescribed. — Flight

Sokratês inculcated self-examination — effect of his conversation
upon others. — Preceptorial and positive exhortation of Sokratês
chiefly brought out by Xenophon. — This was not the peculiarity

faculties. — Negative and indirect scrutiny of Sokratês produced
strong thirst, and active efforts, for the attainment of positive
truth. — Inductive process of scrutiny, and Baconian spirit, of
Sokratês. — Sokratic method tends to create minds capable of forming
conclusions for themselves — not to plant conclusions ready-made. —

Real distinction and variance between Sokratês and the sophists. —
Prodigious efficacy of Sokratês in forming new philosophical minds.

knowledge, or wisdom. — This doctrine defective as stating a part
for the whole. — He was led to this general doctrine by the analogy
of special professions. — Constant reference of Sokratês to duties
of practice and detail. — The derivative reasonings of Sokratês were
of larger range than his general doctrine. — Political opinions of
Sokratês. — Long period during which Sokratês exercised his vocation
as a public converser. — Accusation against him by Melêtus, Anytus,
and Lykon. — The real ground for surprise is, that that accusation
had not been preferred before. — Inevitable unpopularity incurred by
Sokratês in his mission. — It was only from the general toleration
of the Athenian democracy and population, that he was allowed to go
on so long. — Particular circumstances which brought on the trial
of Sokratês. — Private offence of Anytus. — Unpopularity arising to
Sokratês from his connection with Kritias and Alkibiadês. — Enmity
of the poets and rhetors to Sokratês. — Indictment — grounds of the

  TWENTY-FIRST YEAR OF THE WAR. — OLIGARCHY OF FOUR
  HUNDRED AT ATHENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">About</span> a year elapsed
between the catastrophe of the Athenians near Syracuse and the
victory which they gained over the Milêsians, on landing near
Milêtus (from September 413 <small>B.C.</small>, to September 412
<small>B.C.</small>). After the first of those two events, the
complete ruin of Athens had appeared both to her enemies and to
herself, impending and irreparable. But so astonishing, so rapid, and
so energetic had been her rally, that, at the time of the second,
she was found again carrying on a tolerable struggle, though with
impaired resources and on a purely defensive system, against enemies
both bolder and more numerous than ever. Nor is there any reason to
doubt that her foreign affairs might have gone on thus improving,
had they not been endangered at this critical moment by the treason
of a fraction of her own citizens, bringing her again to the brink
of ruin, from which she was only rescued by the incompetence of her
enemies.</p>

<p>That treason took its first rise from the exile Alkibiadês. I have
already recounted how this man, alike unprincipled and energetic,
had thrown himself with his characteristic ardor into the service of
Sparta, and had indicated to her the best means<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> of aiding Syracuse, of inflicting positive
injury upon Athens, and lastly, of provoking revolt among the Ionic
allies of the latter. It was by his boldness and personal connections
in Ionia that the revolt of Chios and Milêtus had been determined.</p>

<p>In the course of a few months, however, he had greatly lost the
confidence of the Spartans. The revolt of the Asiatic dependencies
of Athens had not been accomplished so easily and rapidly as he had
predicted; Chalkideus, the Spartan commander with whom he had acted
was defeated and slain near Milêtus; the ephor Endius, by whom he
was chiefly protected, retained his office only for one year, and
was succeeded by other ephors,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> just about the end of September, or
beginning of October, when the Athenians gained their second victory
near Milêtus, and were on the point of blocking up the town; while
his personal enemy king Agis still remained to persecute him.
Moreover, there was in the character of this remarkable man something
so essentially selfish, vain, and treacherous, that no one could
ever rely upon his faithful coöperation. And as soon as any reverse
occurred, that very energy and ability, which seldom failed him, made
those with whom he acted the more ready to explain the mischance, by
supposing that he had betrayed them.</p>

<p>It was thus that, after the defeat of Milêtus, king Agis was
enabled to discredit Alkibiadês as a traitor to Sparta; upon
which the new ephors sent out at once an order to the general
Astyochus, to put him to death.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Alkibiadês had now an opportunity of tasting
the difference between Spartan and Athenian procedure. Though his
enemies at Athens were numerous and virulent, with all the advantage,
so unspeakable in political warfare, of being able to raise the cry
of irreligion against him, yet the utmost which they could obtain
was that he should be summoned home to take his trial before the
dikastery. At Sparta, without any positive ground of crimination, and
without any idea of judicial trial, his enemies procure an order that
he shall be put to death.</p>

<p>Alkibiadês, however, got intimation of the order in time to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> retire to Tissaphernês.
Probably he was forewarned by Astyochus himself, not ignorant that
so monstrous a deed would greatly alienate the Chians and Milêsians,
nor foreseeing the full mischief which his desertion would bring upon
Sparta. With that flexibility of character which enabled him at once
to master and take up a new position, Alkibiadês soon found means
to insinuate himself into the confidence of the satrap. He began
now to play a game neither Spartan nor Athenian, but Persian and
anti-Hellenic: a game of duplicity to which Tissaphernês himself was
spontaneously disposed, but to which the intervention of a dexterous
Grecian negotiator was indispensable. It was by no means the interest
of the Great King, Alkibiadês urged, to lend such effective aid to
either of the contending parties as would enable it to crush the
other: he ought neither to bring up the Phenician fleet to the aid
of the Lacedæmonians, nor to furnish that abundant pay which would
procure for them indefinite levies of new Grecian force. He ought so
to feed and prolong the war, as to make each party an instrument of
exhaustion and impoverishment against the other, and thus himself
to rise on the ruins of both: first to break down the Athenian
empire by means of the Peloponnesians, and afterwards to expel the
Peloponnesians themselves; which might be effected with little
trouble if they were weakened by a protracted previous struggle.<a
id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Thus far Alkibiadês gave advice, as a Persian counsellor, not
unsuitable to the policy of the court of Susa. But he seldom
gave advice without some view to his own profit, ambition, or
antipathies. Cast off unceremoniously by the Lacedæmonians, he was
now driven to seek restoration in his own country. To accomplish
this object, it was necessary not only that he should preserve her
from being altogether ruined, but that he should present himself
to the Athenians as one who could, if restored, divert the aid of
Tissaphernês from Lacedæmon to Athens. Accordingly, he farther
suggested to the satrap, that while it was essential to his interest
not to permit land power and maritime power to be united in the
same hands, whether Lacedæmonian or Athenian, it would nevertheless
be found easier to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span>
arrange matters with the empire and pretensions of Athens than
with those of Lacedæmon. The former, he argued, neither sought nor
professed any other object than the subjection of her own maritime
dependencies, in return for which she would willingly leave all the
Asiatic Greeks in the hands of the Great King; while the latter,
forswearing all idea of empire, and professing ostentatiously to
aim at the universal enfranchisement of every Grecian city, could
not with the smallest consistency conspire to deprive the Asiatic
Greeks of the same privilege. This view appeared to be countenanced
by the objection which Theramenês and many of the Peloponnesian
officers had taken to the first convention concluded by Chalkideus
and Alkibiadês with Tissaphernês: objections afterwards renewed by
Lichas even against the second modified convention of Theramenês,
and accompanied with an indignant protest against the idea of
surrendering to the Great King all the territory which had been ever
possessed by his predecessors.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>All these latter arguments, whereby Alkibiadês professed to create
in the mind of the satrap a preference for Athens, were either
futile or founded on false assumptions. For on the one hand, even
Lichas never refused to concur in surrendering the Asiatic Greeks to
Persia; while on the other hand, the empire of Athens, so long as
she retained any empire, was pretty sure to be more formidable to
Persia than any efforts undertaken by Sparta under the disinterested
pretence of liberating generally the Grecian cities. Nor did
Tissaphernês at all lend himself to any such positive impression;
though he felt strongly the force of the negative recommendations of
Alkibiadês, that he should do no more for the Peloponnesians than was
sufficient to feed the war, without insuring to them either a speedy
or a decisive success: or rather, this duplicity was so congenial
to his Oriental mind, that there was no need of Alkibiadês to
recommend it. The real use of the Athenian exile, was to assist the
satrap in carrying it into execution; and to provide for him those
plausible pretences and justifications, which he was to issue as a
substitute for effective supplies of men and money. Established along
with Tissaphernês at Magnesia,—the same place which had been<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> occupied about fifty years
before by another Athenian exile, equally unprincipled, and yet
abler, Themistoklês,—Alkibiadês served as interpreter of his views in
all his conversations with the Greeks, and appeared to be thoroughly
in his confidence: an appearance of which he took advantage to pass
himself off falsely upon the Athenians at Samos, as having the power
of turning Persian wealth to the aid of Athens.</p>

<p>The first payment made by Tissaphernês, immediately after the
capture of Iasus and of the revolted Amorgês, to the Peloponnesians
at Milêtus, was at the rate of one drachma per head. But notice was
given that for the future it would be reduced one half, and for this
reduction Alkibiadês undertook to furnish a reason. The Athenians,
he urged, gave no more than half a drachma; not because they could
not afford more, but because, from their long experience of nautical
affairs, they had found that higher pay spoiled the discipline of
the seamen by leading them into excesses and over-indulgence, as
well as by inducing too ready leave of absence to be granted, in
confidence that the high pay would induce them to return when called
for.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
As he probably never expected that such subterfuges, employed at a
moment when Athens was so poor that she could not even pay the half
drachma per head, would carry conviction to any one, so he induced
Tissaphernês to strengthen their effect by individual bribes to the
generals and trierarchs: a mode of argument which was found effectual
in silencing the complaints of all, with the single exception of the
Syracusan Hermokratês. In regard to other Grecian cities who sent
to ask pecuniary aid, and especially Chios, Alkibiadês spoke out
with less reserve. They had been hitherto compelled to contribute
to Athens, he said, and now that they had shaken off this payment,
they must not shrink from imposing upon themselves equal or even
greater burdens in their own defence. Nor was it anything less,
he added, than sheer impudence in the Chians, the richest people
in Greece, if they required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p.
6]</span> a foreign military force for their protection, to require
at the same time that others should furnish the means of paying it.<a
id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At the
same time, however, he intimated,—by way of keeping up hopes for the
future,—that Tissaphernês was at present carrying on the war at his
own cost; but if hereafter remittances should arrive from Susa, the
full rate of pay would be resumed, with the addition of aid to the
Grecian cities in any other way which could be reasonably asked. To
this promise was added an assurance that the Phenician fleet was now
under equipment, and would shortly be brought up to their aid, so as
to give them a superiority which would render resistance hopeless:
an assurance not merely deceitful but mischievous, since it was
employed to dissuade them from all immediate action, and to paralyze
their navy during its moments of fullest vigor and efficiency.
Even the reduced rate of pay was furnished so irregularly, and the
Peloponnesian force kept so starved, that the duplicity of the
satrap became obvious to every one, and was only carried through by
his bribery to the officers.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>While Alkibiadês, as the confidential agent and interpreter of
Tissaphernês, was carrying on this anti-Peloponnesian policy through
the autumn and winter of 412-411 <small>B.C.</small>,—partly during
the stay of the Peloponnesian fleet at Milêtus, partly after it
had moved to Knidus and Rhodes,—he was at the same time opening
correspondence with the Athenian officers at Samos. His breach with
the Peloponnesians, as well as his ostensible position in the service
of Tissaphernês, were facts well known among the Athenian armament;
and his scheme was, to procure both restoration and renewed power in
his native city, by representing himself as competent to bring over
to her the aid and alliance of Persia, through his ascendency over
the mind of the satrap. His hos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span>tility to the democracy, however, was so generally known,
that he despaired of accomplishing his return, unless he could
connect it with an oligarchical revolution; which, moreover, was not
less gratifying to his sentiment of vengeance for the past, than to
his ambition for the future. Accordingly, he sent over a private
message to the officers and trierarchs at Samos, several of them
doubtless his personal friends, desiring to be remembered to the
“best men” in the armament,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> such was one of the standing phrases by
which oligarchical men knew and described each other; and intimating
his anxious wish to come again as a citizen among them, bringing
with him Tissaphernês as their ally. But he would do this only
on condition of the formation of an oligarchical government; nor
would he ever again set foot amidst the odious democracy to whom
he owed his banishment.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Such was the first originating germ of that temporary calamity,
which so nearly brought Athens to absolute ruin, called the Oligarchy
of Four Hundred: a suggestion from the same exile who had already
so deeply wounded his country by sending Gylippus to Syracuse, and
the Lacedæmonian garrison to Dekeleia. As yet, no man in Samos had
thought of a revolution; but the moment that the idea was thus
started, the trierarchs and wealthy men in the armament caught at
it with avidity. To subvert the democracy for their own profit, and
to be rewarded for doing so with the treasures of Persia as a means
of carrying on the war against the Peloponnesians, was an extent of
good fortune greater than they could possibly have hoped. Amidst
the exhaustion of the public treasure at Athens, and the loss of
tribute from her dependencies, it was now the private proprietors,
and most of all, the wealthy proprietors, upon whom the cost of
military operations fell: from which burden they here saw the
prospect of relief, coupled with increased chance of victory. Elate
with so tempting a promise, a deputation of them crossed over from
Samos to the mainland to converse personally with Alkibiadês,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> who again renewed his
assurances in person, that he would bring not only Tissaphernês, but
the Great King himself, into active alliance and coöperation with
Athens, provided they would put down the Athenian democracy, which he
affirmed that the king could not possibly trust.<a id="FNanchor_10"
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He doubtless did not
omit to set forth the other side of the alternative; that, if the
proposition were refused, Persian aid would be thrown heartily into
the scale of the Peloponnesians, in which case, there was no longer
any hope of safety for Athens.</p>

<p>On the return of the deputation with these fresh assurances, the
oligarchical men in Samos came together, both in greater number
and with redoubled ardor, to take their measures for subverting
the democracy. They even ventured to speak of the project openly
among the mass of the armament, who listened to it with nothing but
aversion, but who were silenced at least, though not satisfied, by
being told that the Persian treasury would be thrown open to them on
condition, and only on condition, that they would relinquish their
democracy. Such was at this time the indispensable need of foreign
money for the purposes of the war, such was the certainty of ruin,
if the Persian treasure went to the aid of the enemy, that the most
democratical Athenian might well hesitate when the alternative was
thus laid before him. The oligarchical conspirators, however, knew
well that they had the feeling of the armament altogether against
them, that the best which they could expect from it was a reluctant
acquiescence, and that they must accomplish the revolution by their
own hands and management. They formed themselves into a political
confederacy, or hetæria, for the purpose of discussing the best
measures towards their end. It was resolved to send a deputation
to Athens, with Peisander<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> at the head, to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> make known the new prospects, and to put
the standing oligarchical clubs, or hetæries, into active coöperation
for the purpose of violently breaking up the democracy, and
farther to establish oligarchical governments in all the remaining
dependencies of Athens. They imagined that these dependencies would
be thus induced to remain faithful to her, perhaps even that some of
those which had already revolted might come back to their allegiance,
when once she should be relieved from her democracy, and placed under
the rule of her “best and most virtuous citizens.”</p>

<p>Hitherto, the bargain tendered for acceptance had been, subversion
of the Athenian democracy and restoration of Alkibiadês, on one
hand, against hearty coöperation, and a free supply of gold from
Persia, on the other. But what security was there that such bargain
would be realized, or that when the first part should have been
brought to pass, the second would follow? There was absolutely no
security except the word of Alkibiadês,—very little to be trusted,
even when promising what was in his own power to perform, as we may
recollect from his memorable dealing with the Lacedæmonian envoys at
Athens,—and on the present occasion, vouching for something in itself
extravagant and preposterous. For what reasonable motive could be
imagined to make the Great King shape his foreign policy according
to the interests of Alkibiadês, or to inspire him with such lively
interest in the substitution of oligarchy for democracy at Athens?
This was a question which the oligarchical conspirators at Samos not
only never troubled themselves to raise, but which they had every
motive to suppress. The suggestion of Alkibiadês coincided fully
with their political interest and ambition. Their object was to put
down the democracy, and get possession of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> government for themselves; and the
promise of Persian gold, if they could get it accredited, was
inestimable as a stepping-stone towards this goal, whether it
afterwards turned out to be a delusion or not. The probability is,
that having a strong interest in believing it themselves, and a still
stronger interest in making others believe it, they talked each other
into a sincere persuasion. Without adverting to this fact, we should
be at a loss to understand how the word of such a man as Alkibiadês,
on such a matter, could be so implicitly accepted as to set in motion
a whole train of novel and momentous events.</p>

<p>There was one man, and one man alone, so far as we know, who
ventured openly to call it in question. This was Phrynichus, one of
the generals of the fleet, who had recently given valuable counsel
after the victory of Milêtus; a clear-sighted and sagacious man,
but personally hostile to Alkibiadês, and thoroughly seeing through
his character and projects. Though Phrynichus was afterwards one of
the chief organizers of the oligarchical movement, when it became
detached from, and hostile to Alkibiadês, yet under the actual
circumstances he discountenanced it altogether.<a id="FNanchor_12"
href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Alkibiadês, he
said, had no attachment to oligarchical government rather than to
democratical; nor could he be relied on for standing by it after it
should have been set up. His only purpose was, to make use of the
oligarchical conspiracy now forming, for his own restoration; which,
if brought to pass, could not fail to introduce political discord
into the camp, the greatest misfortune that could at present happen.
As to the Persian king, it was unreasonable to expect that he would
put himself out of his way to aid the Athenians, his old enemies,
in whom he had no confidence, while he had the Peloponnesians
present as allies, with a good naval force and powerful cities in
his own territory, from whom he had never experienced either insult
or annoyance. Moreover, the dependencies of Athens—upon whom it
was now proposed to confer simultaneously with Athens herself, the
blessing of oligarchical government—would<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> receive that boon with indifference.
Those who had already revolted would not come back, those who yet
remained faithful, would not be the more inclined to remain so
longer. Their object would be to obtain autonomy, either under
oligarchy or democracy, as the case might be. Assuredly, they
would not expect better treatment from an oligarchical government
at Athens, than from a democratical; for they knew that those
self-styled “good and virtuous” men, who would form the oligarchy,
were, as ministers of democracy, the chief advisers and instigators
of the people to iniquitous deeds, most commonly for nothing but
their own individual profit. From an Athenian oligarchy, the citizens
of these dependencies had nothing to expect but violent executions
without any judicial trial; but under the democracy, they could
obtain shelter and the means of appeal, while their persecutors were
liable to restraint and chastisement, from the people and the popular
dikasteries. Such, Phrynichus affirmed on his own personal knowledge,
was the genuine feeling among the dependencies of Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Having
thus shown the calculations of the conspirators—as to Alkibiadês,
as to Persia, and as to the allied dependencies—to be all illusory,
Phrynichus concluded by entering his decided protest against adopting
the propositions of Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>But in this protest, borne out afterwards by the result, he
stood nearly alone. The tide of opinion, among the oligarchical
conspir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>ators,
ran so furiously the other way, that it was resolved to despatch
Peisander and others immediately to Athens to consummate the
oligarchical revolution as well as the recall of Alkibiadês; and
at the same time to propose to the people their new intended ally,
Tissaphernês.</p>

<p>Phrynichus knew well what would be the consequence to himself—if
this consummation were brought about, as he foresaw that it probably
would be—from the vengeance of his enemy Alkibiadês against his
recent opposition. Satisfied that the latter would destroy him,
he took measures for destroying Alkibiadês beforehand, even by a
treasonable communication to the Lacedæmonian admiral Astyochus at
Milêtus, to whom he sent a secret account of the intrigues which
the Athenian exile was carrying on at Samos to the prejudice of the
Peloponnesians, prefaced with an awkward apology for this sacrifice
of the interests of his country to the necessity of protecting
himself against a personal enemy. But Phrynichus was imperfectly
informed of the real character of the Spartan commander, or of his
relations with Tissaphernês and Alkibiadês. Not merely was the latter
now at Magnesia, under the protection of the satrap, and out of the
power of the Lacedæmonians, but Astyochus, a traitor to his duty
through the gold of Tissaphernês, went up thither to show the letter
of Phrynichus to the very person whom it was intended to expose.
Alkibiadês forthwith sent intelligence to the generals and officers
at Samos, of the step taken by Phrynichus, and pressed them to put
him to death.</p>

<p>The life of Phrynichus now hung by a thread, and was probably
preserved only by that respect for judicial formalities so deeply
rooted in the Athenian character. In the extremity of danger,
he resorted to a still more subtle artifice to save himself.
He despatched a second letter to Astyochus, complaining of the
violation of confidence in regard to the former, but at the same time
intimating that he was now willing to betray to the Lacedæmonians the
camp and armament at Samos. He invited Astyochus to come and attack
the place, which was as yet unfortified, explaining minutely in what
manner the attack could be best conducted. And he concluded by saying
that this, as well as every other means of defence, must be pardoned
to one whose life was in danger from a personal enemy. Foreseeing
that Astyochus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p. 13]</span>
would betray this letter as he had betrayed the former, Phrynichus
waited a proper time, and then revealed to the camp the intention
of the enemy to make an attack, as if it had reached him by private
information. He insisted on the necessity of immediate precautions,
and himself, as general, superintended the work of fortification,
which was soon completed. Presently arrived a letter from Alkibiadês,
communicating to the army that Phrynichus had betrayed them, and that
the Peloponnesians were on the point of making an attack. But this
letter, arriving after the precautions taken by order of Phrynichus
himself had been already completed, was construed as a mere trick on
the part of Alkibiadês himself, through his acquaintance with the
intentions of the Peloponnesians, to raise a charge of treasonable
correspondence against his personal enemy. The impression thus
made by his second letter effaced the taint which had been left
upon Phrynichus by the first, insomuch that the latter stood
exculpated on both charges.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>But Phrynichus, though successful in extricating himself,
failed thoroughly in his manœuvre against the influence and life
of Alkibiadês; in whose favor the oligarchical movement not only
went on, but was transferred from Samos to Athens. On arriving
at the latter place, Peisander and his companions laid before
the public assembly the projects which had been conceived by the
oligarchs at Samos. The people were invited to restore Alkibiadês
and renounce their democratical constitution; in return for
which, they were assured of obtaining the Persian king as an
ally, and of overcoming the Peloponnesians.<a id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Violent was the
storm which these propositions raised in the public as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>sembly. Many speakers
rose in animated defence of the democracy; few, if any, distinctly
against it. The opponents of Alkibiadês indignantly denounced the
mischief of restoring him, in violation of the laws, and in reversal
of a judicial sentence, while the Eumolpidæ and Kerykes, the sacred
families connected with the Eleusinian mysteries which Alkibiadês had
violated, entered their solemn protest on religious grounds to the
same effect. Against all these vehement opponents, whose impassioned
invectives obtained the full sympathy of the assembly, Peisander had
but one simple reply. He called them forward successively by name,
and put to each the question: “What hope have you of salvation for
the city, when the Peloponnesians have a naval force against us fully
equal to ours, together with a greater number of allied cities, and
when the king as well as Tissaphernês are supplying them with money,
while we have no money left? What hope have you of salvation, unless
we can persuade the king to come over to our side?” The answer was a
melancholy negative, or perhaps not less melancholy silence. “Well,
then, rejoined Peisander, that object cannot possibly be attained,
unless we conduct our political affairs for the future in a more
moderate way, and put the powers of government more in the hands of a
few, and unless we recall Alkibiadês, the only man now living who is
competent to do the business. Under present circumstances, we surely
shall not lay greater stress upon our political constitution than
upon the salvation of the city; the rather as what we now enact may
be hereafter modified, if it be found not to answer.”</p>

<p>Against the proposed oligarchical change, the repugnance of the
assembly was alike angry and unanimous. But they were silenced by
the imperious necessity of the case, as the armament at Samos had
been before; and admitting the alternative laid down by Peisander,
as I have observed already, the most democratical citizen might be
embarrassed as to his vote. Whether any speaker, like Phrynichus
at Samos, arraigned the fallacy of the alternative, and called
upon Peisander for some guarantee, better than mere asseveration,
of the benefits to come, we are not informed. But the general vote
of the assembly, reluctant and only passed in the hope of future
change, sanctioned his recom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p.
15]</span>mendation.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He and ten other envoys, invested with
full powers of negotiating with Alkibiadês and Tissaphernês, were
despatched to Ionia immediately. Peisander at the same time obtained
from the assembly a vote deposing Phrynichus from his command;
under the accusation of having traitorously caused the loss of
Iasus and the capture of Amorgês, after the battle of Milêtus, but
from the real certainty that he would prove an insuperable bar to
all negotiations with Alkibiadês. Phrynichus, with his colleague
Skironidês, being thus displaced, Leon and Diomedon were sent to
Samos as commanders in their stead; an appointment of which, as
will be presently seen, Peisander was far from anticipating the
consequences.</p>

<p>Before his departure for Asia, he took a step yet more important.
He was well aware that the recent vote—a result of fear inspired by
the war, representing a sentiment utterly at variance with that of
the assembly, and only procured as the price of Persian aid against
a foreign enemy—would never pass into a reality by the spontaneous
act of the people themselves. It was, indeed, indispensable as a
first step; partly as an authority to himself, partly also as a
confession of the temporary weakness of the democracy, and as a
sanction and encouragement for the oligarchical forces to show
themselves. But the second step yet remained to be performed; that
of calling these forces into energetic action, organizing an amount
of violence sufficient to extort from the people actual submission
in addition to verbal acquiescence, and thus, as it were, tying down
the patient while the process of emasculation was being consummated.
Peisander visited all the various political clubs, conspiracies,
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> hetæries,
which were habitual and notorious at Athens; associations, bound
together by oath, among the wealthy citizens, partly for purposes of
amusement, but chiefly pledging the members to stand by each other
in objects of political ambition, in judicial trials, in accusation
or defence of official men after the period of office had expired,
in carrying points through the public assembly, etc. Among these
clubs were distributed most of “the best citizens, the good and
honorable men, the elegant men, the well known, the temperate, the
honest and moderate men,”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> etc., to employ that complimentary
phraseology by which wealthy and anti-popular politicians have
chosen to designate each other, in ancient as well as in modern
times. And though there were doubtless individuals among them who
deserved these appellations in their best sense, yet the general
character of the clubs was not the less exclusive and oligarchical.
In the details of political life, they had different partialities
as well as different antipathies, and were oftener in opposition
than in coöperation with each other. But they furnished, when taken
together, a formidable anti-popular force; generally either in
abeyance or disseminated in the accomplishment of smaller political
measures and separate personal successes; but capable, at a special
crisis, of being evoked, organized, and put in conjoint attack, for
the subversion of the democracy. Such was the important movement
now initiated by Peisander. He visited separately each of these
clubs, put them into communication with each other, and exhorted
them all to joint aggressive action against their common enemy the
democracy, at a moment when it was already intimidated and might
be finally overthrown.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span></p>

<p>Having taken other necessary measures towards the same purpose,
Peisander left Athens with his colleagues to enter upon his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span> negotiation with
Tissaphernês. But the coöperation and aggressive movement of the
clubs which he had originated was prosecuted with increased ardor
during his absence, and even fell into hands more organizing and
effective than his own. The rhetorical teacher Antiphon, of the deme
Rhamnus, took it in hand especially, acquired the confidence of the
clubs, and drew the plan of campaign against the democracy. He was a
man estimable in private life, and not open to pecuniary corruption:
in other respects, of preëminent ability,—in contrivance, judgment,
speech, and action. The profession to which he belonged, generally
unpopular among the democracy, excluding him from taking rank as
a speaker either in the public assembly or the dikastery: for a
rhetorical teacher, contending in either of them against a private
speaker, to repeat a remark already once made, was considered to
stand at the same unfair advantage, as a fencing-master fighting a
duel with a gentleman would be held to stand in modern times. Thus
debarred himself from the showy celebrity of Athenian political life,
Antiphon became only the more consummate, as a master of advice,
calculation, scheming, and rhetorical composition,<a id="FNanchor_19"
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to assist the celebrity
of others; insomuch that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p.
19]</span> his silent assistance in political and judicial debates,
as a sort of chamber-counsel, was highly appreciated and largely
paid. Now such were precisely the talents required for the present
occasion; while Antiphon, who hated the democracy for having hitherto
kept him in the shade, gladly bent his full talents towards its
subversion.</p>

<p>Such was the man to whom Peisander, in departing, chiefly confided
the task of organizing the anti-popular clubs, for the consummation
of the revolution already in immediate prospect. His chief auxiliary
was Theramenês, another Athenian, now first named, of eminent ability
and cunning. His father (either natural or by adoption), Agnon, was
one of the probûli, and had formerly been founder of Amphipolis.
Even Phrynichus—whose sagacity we have already had occasion to
appreciate, and who, from hatred towards Alkibiadês, had pronounced
himself decidedly against the oligarchical movement at Samos—became
zealous in forwarding the movement at Athens, after his dismissal
from the command. He brought to the side of Antiphon and Theramenês
a contriving head not inferior to theirs, coupled with daring and
audacity even superior. Under such skilful leaders, the anti-popular
force of Athens was organized with a deep skill, and directed with a
dexterous wickedness, never before witnessed in Greece.</p>

<p>At the time when Peisander and the other envoys reached Ionia,
seemingly about the end of January or beginning of February 411
<small>B.C.</small>, the Peloponnesian fleet had
already quitted Milêtus and gone to Knidus and Rhodes, on which
latter island Leon and Diomedon made some hasty descents, from the
neighboring island of Chalkê. At the same time the Athenian armament
at Chios was making progress in the siege of that place and the
construction of the neighboring fort at Delphinium. Pedaritus, the
Lacedæmonian governor of the island, had sent pressing messages to
solicit aid from the Peloponnesians at Rhodes, but no aid arrived;
and he therefore resolved to attempt a general<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> sally and attack upon the Athenians
with his whole force, foreign as well as Chian. Though at first he
obtained some success, the battle ended in his complete defeat and
death, with great slaughter of the Chian troops, and with the loss of
many whose shields were captured in the pursuit.<a id="FNanchor_20"
href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The Chians, now reduced
to greater straits than before, and beginning to suffer severely from
famine, were only enabled to hold out by a partial reinforcement soon
afterwards obtained from the Peloponnesian guardships at Milêtus. A
Spartan named Leon, who had come out in the vessel of Antisthenês as
one of the epibatæ, or marines, conducted this reinforcing squadron
of twelve triremes, chiefly Thurian and Syracusan, succeeding
Pedaritus in the general command of the island.<a id="FNanchor_21"
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>It was while Chios seemed thus likely to be recovered by
Athens—and while the superior Peloponnesian fleet was paralyzed at
Rhodes by Persian intrigues and bribes—that Peisander arrived in
Ionia to open his negotiations with Alkibiadês and Tissaphernês.
He was enabled to announce that the subversion of the democracy
at Athens was already begun, and would soon be consummated: and
he now required the price which had been promised in exchange,
Persian alliance and aid to Athens against<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> the Peloponnesians. But Alkibiadês knew
well that he had promised what he had not the least chance of being
able to perform. The satrap had appeared to follow his advice,—or
had rather followed his own inclination, employing Alkibiadês as an
instrument and auxiliary,—in the endeavor to wear out both parties,
and to keep them nearly on an equality until each should ruin the
other. But he was no way disposed to identify himself with the cause
of Athens, and to break decidedly with the Peloponnesians, especially
at a moment when their fleet was both the greater of the two, and
in occupation of an island close to his own satrapy. Accordingly
Alkibiadês, when summoned by the Athenian envoys to perform his
engagement, found himself in a dilemma from which he could only
escape by one of his characteristic manœuvres.</p>

<p>Receiving the envoys himself in conjunction with Tissaphernês, and
speaking on behalf of the latter, he pushed his demands to an extent
which he knew that the Athenians would never concede, in order that
the rupture might seem to be on their side, and not on his. First,
he required the whole of Ionia to be conceded to the Great King;
next, all the neighboring islands, with some other items besides.<a
id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Large
as these requisitions were, comprehending the cession of Lesbos
and Samos as well as Chios, and replacing the Persian monarchy in
the condition in which it had stood in 496 <small>B.C.</small>,
before the Ionic revolt, Peisander and his colleagues granted them
all: so that Alkibiadês was on the point of seeing his deception
exposed and frustrated. At last, he bethought himself of a fresh
demand, which touched Athenian pride, as well as Athenian safety,
in the tenderest place. He required that the Persian king should
be held free to build ships of war in unlimited number, and to
keep them sailing along the coast as he might think fit, through
all these new portions of territory. After the immense concessions
already made, the envoys not only rejected this fresh demand at
once, but resented it as an insult, which exposed the real drift
and purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span> of
Alkibiadês. Not merely did it cancel the boasted treaty, called
the Peace of Kallias, concluded about forty years before between
Athens and Persia, and limiting the Persian ships of war to the sea
eastward of Phasêlis, but it extinguished the maritime empire of
Athens, and compromised the security of all the coasts and islands of
the Ægean. To see Lesbos, Chios, and Samos, etc., in possession of
Persia, was sufficiently painful; but if there came to be powerful
Persian fleets on these islands it would be the certain precursor
and means of farther conquests to the westward, and would revive
the aggressive dispositions of the Great King, as they had stood at
the beginning of the reign of Xerxes. Peisander and his comrades,
abruptly breaking off the debate, returned to Samos; indignant at the
discovery, which they now made for the first time, that Alkibiadês
had juggled them from the outset, and was imposing conditions which
he knew to be inadmissible.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They still appear, however, to have
thought that Alkibiadês acted thus, not because he <i>could</i> not, but
because he <i>would</i> not, bring about the alliance under discussion.<a
id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> They
suspected him of playing false with the oligarchical movement which
he had himself instigated, and of projecting the accomplishment of
his own restoration, coupled with the alliance of Tissaphernês,
into the bosom of the democracy which he had begun by denouncing.
Such was the light in which they presented his conduct, venting
their disappointment in invectives against his duplicity, and in
asseverations that he was after all unsuitable for a place in
oligarchical society. Such declarations,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> circulated at Samos, to account for their
unexpected failure in realizing the hopes which they had raised,
created among the armament an impression that Alkibiadês was really
favorable to the democracy, at the same time leaving unabated the
prestige of his unbounded ascendency over Tissaphernês and the
Great King. We shall presently see the effects resulting from this
belief.</p>

<p>Immediately after the rupture of the negotiations, however, the
satrap took a step well calculated to destroy the hopes of the
Athenians altogether, so far as Persian aid was concerned. Though
persisting in his policy of lending no decisive assistance to either
party and of merely prolonging the war so as to enfeeble both, he
yet began to fear that he was pushing matters too far against the
Peloponnesians, who had now been two months inactive at Rhodes, with
their large fleet hauled ashore. He had no treaty with them actually
in force, since Lichas had disallowed the two previous conventions;
nor had he furnished them with pay or maintenance. His bribes to
the officers had hitherto kept the armament quiet; yet we do not
distinctly see how so large a body of men found subsistence.<a
id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He
was now, however, apprized that they could find subsistence no
longer, and that they would probably desert, or commit depredations
on the coast of his satrapy, or perhaps be driven to hasten on a
general action with the Athenians, under desperate circumstances.
Under such apprehensions he felt compelled to put himself again in
communication with them, to furnish them with pay, and to conclude
with them a third convention, the proposition of which he had refused
to entertain at Knidus. He therefore went to Kaunus, invited the
Peloponnesian leaders to Milêtus, and concluded with them near that
town a treaty to the following effect:—</p>

<p>“In this thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, and in the
ephorship of Alexippidas at Lacedæmon, a convention is hereby
concluded by the Lacedæmonians and their allies, with Tissa<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span>phernês and Hieramenês and
the sons of Pharnakês, respecting the affairs of the king and of the
Lacedæmonians and their allies. The territory of the king, as much of
it as is in Asia, shall belong to the king. Let the king determine as
he chooses respecting his own territory. The Lacedæmonians and their
allies shall not approach the king’s territory with any mischievous
purpose, nor shall the king approach that of the Lacedæmonians
and their allies with any like purpose. If any one among the
Lacedæmonians or their allies shall approach the king’s territory
with mischievous purpose, the Lacedæmonians and their allies shall
hinder him: if any one from the king’s territory shall approach the
Lacedæmonians or their allies with mischievous purpose, the king
shall hinder him. Tissaphernês shall provide pay and maintenance,
for the fleet now present, at the rate already stipulated, until the
king’s fleet shall arrive; after that, it shall be at the option of
the Lacedæmonians to maintain their own fleet, if they think fit;
or, if they prefer, Tissaphernês shall furnish maintenance, and at
the close of the war the Lacedæmonians shall repay to him what they
have received. After the king’s fleet shall have arrived, the two
fleets shall carry on war conjointly, in such manner as shall seem
good to Tissaphernês and the Lacedæmonians and their allies. If
they choose to close the war with the Athenians, they shall close
it only by joint consent.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In comparing this third convention with the two preceding, we
find that nothing is now stipulated as to any territory except
the continent of Asia; which is insured unreservedly to the king,
of course with all the Greek residents planted upon it. But by a
diplomatic finesse, the terms of the treaty imply that this is not
<i>all</i> the territory which the king is entitled to claim, though
nothing is covenanted as to any remainder.<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Next, this third
treaty includes Pharnabazus, the son of Pharnakês, with his satrapy
of Daskylium, and Hieramenês, with his district, the extent and
position of which we do not know; while in the former<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> treaties no other satrap
except Tissaphernês had been concerned. We must recollect that the
Peloponnesian fleet included those twenty-seven triremes, which
had been brought across by Kalligeitus expressly for the aid of
Pharnabazus; and therefore that the latter now naturally became a
party to the general operations. Thirdly, we here find, for the first
time, formal announcement of a Persian fleet about to be brought
up as auxiliary to the Peloponnesians. This was a promise which
the satrap now set forth more plainly than before, to amuse them,
and to abate the mistrust which they had begun to conceive of his
sincerity. It served the temporary purpose of restraining them from
any immediate act of despair hostile to his interests, which was all
that he looked for. While he renewed his payments, therefore, for
the moment, he affected to busy himself in orders and preparations
for the fleet from Phenicia.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Peloponnesian fleet was now ordered to move from Rhodes.
Before it quitted that island, however, envoys came thither from
Eretria and from Orôpus; which latter place, a dependency on the
northeastern frontier of Attica, though protected by an Athenian
garrison, had recently been surprised and captured by the Bœotians.
The loss of Orôpus much increased the facilities for the revolt of
Eubœa; and these envoys came to entreat aid from the Peloponnesian
fleet, to second that island in that design. The Peloponnesian
commanders, however, felt themselves under prior obligation to
relieve the sufferers at Chios, towards which island they first
bent their course. But they had scarcely passed the Triopian cape,
when they saw the Athenian squadron from Chalkê dogging their
motions. Though there was no wish on either side for a general
battle, yet they saw evidently that the Athenians would not permit
them to pass by Samos, and get to the relief of Chios, without one.
Renouncing, therefore, the project of relieving Chios, they again
concentrated their force at Milêtus, while the Athenian fleet was
also again united at Samos.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> It was about the end of March, 411
<small>B.C.</small>, that the two fleets were thus replaced in
the stations which they had occupied four months previously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span></p> <p>After
the breach with Alkibiadês, and still more after this manifest
reconciliation of Tissaphernês with the Peloponnesians, Peisander
and the oligarchical conspirators at Samos had to reconsider their
plan of action. They would not have begun the movement at first, had
they not been instigated by Alkibiadês, and furnished by him with the
treacherous delusion of Persian alliance to cheat and paralyze the
people. They had, indeed, motives enough, from their own personal
ambition, to originate it of themselves, apart from Alkibiadês; but
without the hopes—equally useful for their purpose, whether false
or true—connected with his name, they would have had no chance of
achieving the first step. Now, however, that first step had been
achieved, before the delusive expectation of Persian gold was
dissipated. The Athenian people had been familiarized with the idea
of a subversion of their constitution, in consideration of a certain
price: it remained to extort from them at the point of the sword,
without paying the price, what they had thus consented to sell.<a
id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Moreover, the leaders of the scheme felt themselves already
compromised, so that they could not recede with safety. They had set
in motion their partisans at Athens, where the system of murderous
intimidation, though the news had not as yet reached Samos, was
already in full swing: so that they felt constrained to persevere,
as the only chance of preservation to themselves. At the same time,
all that faint pretence of public benefit, in the shape of Persian
alliance, which had been originally attached to it, and which might
have been conceived to enlist in the scheme some timid patriots, was
now entirely withdrawn; and nothing remained except a naked, selfish,
and unscrupulous scheme of ambition, not only ruining the freedom of
Athens at home, but crippling and imperiling her before the foreign
enemy, at a moment when her entire strength was scarcely adequate to
the contest. The conspirators resolved to persevere, at all hazards,
both in breaking down the constitution and in carrying on the foreign
war. Most of them being rich men, they were con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>tent, Thucydidês observes, to defray the
cost out of their own purses, now that they were contending, not for
their country, but for their own power and profit.<a id="FNanchor_31"
href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>They lost no time in proceeding to execution, immediately after
returning to Samos from the abortive conference with Alkibiadês.
While they despatched Peisander with five of the envoys back to
Athens, to consummate what was already in progress there, and the
remaining five to oligarchize the dependent allies, they organized
all their partisan force in the armament, and began to take measures
for putting down the democracy in Samos itself. That democracy had
been the product of a forcible revolution, effected about ten months
before, by the aid of three Athenian triremes. It had since preserved
Samos from revolting like Chios: it was now the means of preserving
the democracy at Athens itself. The partisans of Peisander, finding
it an invincible obstacle to their views, contrived to gain over
a party of the leading Samians now in authority under it. Three
hundred of these latter, a portion of those who ten months before
had risen in arms to put down the preëxisting oligarchy, now
enlisted as conspirators along with the Athenian oligarchs, to put
down the Samian democracy, and get possession of the government for
themselves. The new alliance was attested and cemented, according to
genuine oligarchical practice, by a murder without judicial trial,
or an assassination, for which a suitable victim was at hand. The
Athenian Hyperbolus, who had been ostracized some years before by the
coalition of Nikias and Alkibiadês, together with their respective
partisans,—ostracized as Thucydidês tells us, not from any fear of
his power and over-ascendent influence, but from his low character,
and from his being a disgrace to the city, and thus ostracized by
an abuse of the institution,—was now resident at Samos. As he was
not a Samian, and had, moreover, been in banishment during the last
five or six years, he could have had no power either in the island
or the armament, and therefore his death served no prospective<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span> purpose. But he
represented the demagogic and accusatory eloquence of the democracy,
the check upon official delinquency; so that he served as a common
object of antipathy to Athenian and Samian oligarchs. Some of the
Athenian partisans, headed by Charmînus, one of the generals, in
concert with the Samian conspirators, seized Hyperbolus and put him
to death, seemingly with some other victims at the same time.<a
id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>But though these joint assassinations served as a pledge to
each section of the conspirators for the fidelity of the other, in
respect to farther operations, they at the same time gave warning
to opponents. Those leading men at Samos who remained attached to
the democracy, looking abroad for defence against the coming attack,
made earnest appeal to Leon and Diomedon, the two generals most
recently arrived from Athens in substitution for Phrynichus and
Skironidês,—men sincerely devoted to the democracy, and adverse to
all oligarchical change, as well as to the trierarch Thrasyllus, to
Thrasybulus, son of Lykus, then serving as an hoplite, and to many
others of the pronounced democrats and patriots in the Athenian
armament. They made appeal not simply in behalf of their own personal
safety and of their own democracy, now threatened by conspirators of
whom a portion were Athenians, but also on grounds of public interest
to Athens; since, if Samos became oligarchized, its sympathy with
the Athenian democracy and its fidelity to the alliance would be at
an end. At this moment the most recent events which had occurred
at Athens, presently to be told, were not<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span> known, and the democracy was considered
as still subsisting there.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"
class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>To stand by the assailed democracy of Samos, and to preserve the
island itself, now the mainstay of the shattered Athenian empire,
were motives more than sufficient to awaken the Athenian leaders
thus solicited. Commencing a personal canvass among the soldiers and
seamen, and invoking their interference to avert the overthrow of the
Samian democracy, they found the general sentiment decidedly in their
favor, but most of all, among the parali, or crew of the consecrated
public trireme, called the paralus. These men were the picked seamen
of the state,—each of them not merely a freeman, but a full Athenian
citizen, receiving higher pay than the ordinary seamen, and known as
devoted to the democratical constitution, with an active repugnance
to oligarchy itself as well as to everything which scented of it.<a
id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
vigilance of Leon and Diomedon on the defensive side, counteracted
the machinations of their colleague Charmînus, along with the
conspirators, and provided for the Samian democracy faithful
auxiliaries constantly ready for action. Presently, the conspirators
made a violent attack to overthrow the government; but though they
chose their own moment and opportunity, they still found themselves
thoroughly worsted in the struggle, especially through the energetic
aid of the parali. Thirty of their number were slain in the contest,
and three of the most guilty afterwards condemned to banishment. The
victorious party took no farther revenge, even upon the remainder
of the three hundred conspirators, granted a general amnesty,
and did their best to reëstablish constitutional and harmonious
working of the democracy.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"
class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span></p>

<p>Chæreas, an Athenian trierarch, who had been forward in the
contest, was sent in the paralus itself to Athens, to make
communication of what had occurred. But this democratical crew, on
reaching their native city, instead of being received with that
welcome which they doubtless expected, found a state of things
not less odious than surprising. The democracy of Athens had been
subverted: instead of the senate of Five Hundred, and the assembled
people, an oligarchy of Four Hundred self-installed persons were
enthroned with sovereign authority in the senate-house. The first
order of the Four Hundred, on hearing that the paralus had entered
Peiræus, was to imprison two or three of the crew, and to remove all
the rest from their own privileged trireme aboard a common trireme,
with orders to depart forthwith and to cruise near Eubœa. The
commander, Chæreas, found means to escape, and returned back to Samos
to tell the unwelcome news.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The steps, whereby this oligarchy of Four Hundred had been
gradually raised up to their new power, must be taken up from the
time when Peisander quitted Athens,—after having obtained the vote
of the public assembly authorizing him to treat with Alkibiadês and
Tissaphernês,—and after having set on foot a joint organization
and conspiracy of all the anti-popular clubs, which fell under the
management especially of Antiphon and Theramenês, afterwards aided by
Phrynichus. All the members of that Board of Elders called Probûli,
who had been named after the defeat in Sicily, with Agnon, father of
Theramenês, at their head,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a>—together with many other leading citizens,
some of whom had been counted among the firmest friends of the
democracy, joined the conspiracy; while the oligarchical and the
neutral rich came into it with ardor; so that a body of partisans
was formed both numerous and well provided with money. Antiphon
did not attempt to bring them together, or to make any public
demonstration, armed or unarmed, for the purpose of overawing the
actual authorities. He permitted the sen<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span>ate and the public assembly to go on
meeting and debating as usual; but his partisans, neither the names
nor the numbers of whom were publicly known, received from him
instructions both when to speak and what language to hold. The great
topic upon which they descanted, was the costliness of democratical
institutions in the present distressed state of the finances, the
heavy tax imposed upon the state by paying the senators, the dikasts,
the ekklesiasts, or citizens who attended the public assembly, etc.
The state could now afford to pay only those soldiers who fought in
its defence, nor ought any one else to touch the public money. It was
essential, they insisted, to exclude from the political franchise all
except a select body of Five Thousand, composed of those who were
best able to do service to the city by person and by purse.</p>

<p>The extensive disfranchisement involved in this last proposition
was quite sufficiently shocking to the ears of an Athenian assembly.
But in reality the proposition was itself a juggle, never intended
to become reality, and representing something far short of what
Antiphon and his partisans intended. Their design was to appropriate
the powers of government to themselves simply, without control
or partnership, leaving this body of Five Thousand not merely
unconvened, but non-existent, as a mere empty name to impose upon
the citizens generally. Of this real intention, however, not a word
was as yet spoken. The projected body of Five Thousand was the theme
preached upon by all the party orators; yet without submitting any
substantive motion for the change, which could not be yet done
without illegality.</p>

<p>Even thus indirectly advocated, the project of cutting down the
franchise to Five Thousand, and of suppressing all the paid civil
functions, was a change sufficiently violent to call forth abundant
opponents. For such opponents Antiphon was fully prepared. Of the
men who thus stood forward in opposition, either all, or at least
all the most prominent, were successively taken off by private
assassination. The first of them who thus perished was Androklês,
distinguished as a demagogue, or popular speaker, and marked out to
vengeance not only by that circumstance, but by the farther fact
that he had been among the most vehement accusers of Alkibiadês
before his exile. For at this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p.
32]</span> time, the breach of Peisander with Tissaphernês and
Alkibiadês had not yet become known at Athens, so that the latter
was still supposed to be on the point of returning home as a member
of the contemplated oligarchical government. After Androklês, many
other speakers of similar sentiments perished in the same way, by
unknown hands. A band of Grecian youths, strangers, and got together
from different cities,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> was organized for the business: the
victims were all chosen on the same special ground, and the deed
was so skilfully perpetrated that neither director nor instrument
ever became known. After these assassinations—sure, special,
secret, and systematic, emanating from an unknown directory, like a
Vehmic tribunal—had continued for some time, the terror which they
inspired became intense and universal. No justice could be had, no
inquiry could be instituted, even for the death of the nearest and
dearest relative. At last, no man dared to demand or even to mention
inquiry, looking upon himself as fortunate that he had escaped the
same fate in his own person. So finished an organization, and such
well-aimed blows, raised a general belief that the conspirators
were much more numerous than they were in reality. And as it
turned out that there were persons among them who had before been
accounted hearty democrats,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> so at last dismay and mistrust became<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span> universally prevalent.
Nor did any one dare even to express indignation at the murders
going on, much less to talk about redress or revenge, for fear that
he might be communicating with one of the unknown conspirators.
In the midst of this terrorism, all opposition ceased in the
senate and public assembly, so that the speakers of the conspiring
oligarchy appeared to carry an unanimous assent.<a id="FNanchor_40"
href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Such was the condition to which things had been brought in Athens,
by Antiphon and the oligarchical conspirators acting under his
direction, at the time when Peisander and the five envoys arrived
thither returning from Samos. It is probable that they had previously
transmitted home from Samos news of the rupture with Alkibiadês, and
of the necessity of prosecuting the conspiracy without farther view
either to him or to the Persian alliance. Such news would probably
be acceptable both to Antiphon and Phrynichus, both of them personal
enemies of Alkibiadês; especially Phrynichus, who had pronounced him
to be incapable of fraternizing with an oligarchical revolution.<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> At
any rate, the plans of Antiphon had been independent of all view
to Persian aid, and had been directed to carry the revolution by
means of naked, exorbitant, and well-directed fear, without any
intermixture of hope or any prospect of public benefit. Peisander
found the reign of terror fully matured. He had not come direct
from Samos to Athens, but had halted in his voyage at various
allied dependencies, while the other five envoys, as well as a
partisan named Diotrephês, had been sent to Thasos and elsewhere;<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
all for the same purpose, of putting down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_34">[p. 34]</span> democracies in those allied cities where
they existed, and establishing oligarchies in their room. Peisander
made this change at Tênos, Andros, Karystus, Ægina, and elsewhere;
collecting from these several places a regiment of three hundred
hoplites, which he brought with him to Athens as a sort of body-guard
to his new oligarchy.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He could not know until he reached Peiræus
the full success of the terrorism organized by Antiphon and the rest;
so that he probably came prepared to surmount a greater resistance
than he actually found. As the facts stood, so completely had the
public opinion and spirit been subdued, that he was enabled to put
the finishing stroke at once, and his arrival was the signal for
consummating the revolution, first, by an extorted suspension of the
tutelary constitutional sanction, next, by the more direct employment
of armed force.</p>

<p>First, he convoked a public assembly, in which he proposed a
decree, naming ten commissioners with full powers, to prepare
propositions for such political reform as they should think
advisable, and to be ready by a given day.<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> According to the
usual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span> practice,
this decree must previously have been approved in the senate of Five
Hundred, before it was submitted to the people. Such was doubtless
the case in the present instance, and the decree passed without
any opposition. On the day fixed, a fresh assembly met, which
Peisander and his partisans caused to be held, not in the usual
place, called the Pnyx, within the city walls, but at a place called
Kolônus, ten stadia, rather more than a mile, without the walls,<a
id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> north
of the city. Kolônus was a temple of Poseidon, within the precinct of
which the assembly was inclosed for the occasion. Such an assembly
was not likely to be numerous, wherever held,<a id="FNanchor_46"
href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> since there could be
little motive to attend, when freedom of debate was extinguished;
but the oligarchical conspirators now transferred it without the
walls; selecting a narrow area for the meeting, in order that they
might lessen still farther the chance of numerous attendance, an
assembly which they fully designed should be the last in the history
of Athens. They were thus also more out of the reach of an armed
movement in the city, as well as enabled to post their own armed
partisans around, under color of protecting the meeting against
disturbance by the Lacedæmonians from Dekeleia.</p>

<p>The proposition of the newly-appointed commissioners—probably
Peisander, Antiphon, and other partisans themselves—was exceedingly
short and simple. They merely moved the abolition<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span> of the celebrated
Graphê Paranomôn; that is, they proposed that every Athenian
citizen should have full liberty of making any anti-constitutional
proposition that he chose, and that every other citizen should be
interdicted, under heavy penalties, from prosecuting him by graphê
paranomôn indictment on the score of informality, illegality, or
unconstitutionality, or from doing him any other mischief. This
proposition was adopted without a single dissentient. It was thought
more formal by the directing chiefs to sever this proposition
pointedly from the rest, and to put it, singly and apart, into the
mouth of the special commissioners; since it was the legalizing
condition of every other positive change which they were about to
move afterwards. Full liberty being thus granted to make any motion,
however anti-constitutional, and to dispense with all the established
formalities, such as preliminary authorization by the senate,
Peisander now came forward with his substantive propositions to the
following effect:—</p>

<p>1. All the existing democratical magistracies were suppressed
at once, and made to cease for the future. 2. No civil functions
whatever were hereafter to be salaried. 3. To constitute a new
government, a committee of five persons were named forthwith, who
were to choose a larger body of one hundred; that is, one hundred
including the five choosers themselves. Each individual out of
this body of one hundred, was to choose three persons. 4. A body
of Four Hundred was thus constituted, who were to take their seat
in the senate-house, and to carry on the government with unlimited
powers, according to their own discretion. 5. They were to convene
the Five Thousand, whenever they might think fit.<a id="FNanchor_47"
href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> All was passed without
a dissentient voice.</p>

<p>The invention and employment of this imaginary aggregate of
Five Thousand was not the least dexterous among the combinations
of Antiphon. No one knew who these Five Thousand were: yet the
resolution just adopted purported,—not that such a number of citizens
should be singled out and constituted, either by choice, or by lot,
or in some determinate manner which should exhibit them to the
view and knowledge of others,—but that the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> Four Hundred should convene <i>The Five
Thousand</i>, whenever they thought proper: thus assuming the latter
to be a list already made up and notorious, at least to the Four
Hundred themselves. The real fact was, that the Five Thousand existed
nowhere except in the talk and proclamations of the conspirators,
as a supplement of fictitious auxiliaries. They did not even exist
as individual names on paper, but simply as an imposturous nominal
aggregate. The Four Hundred, now installed, formed the entire and
exclusive rulers of the state.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48"
class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But the mere name of the Five Thousand,
though it was nothing more than a name, served two important
purposes for Antiphon and his conspiracy. First, it admitted of
being falsely produced, especially to the armament at Samos, as
proof of a tolerably numerous and popular body of equal, qualified,
concurrent citizens, all intended to take their turn by rotation in
exercising the powers of government; thus lightening the odium of
extreme usurpation to the Four Hundred, and passing them off merely
as the earliest section of the Five Thousand, put into office for
a few months, and destined at the end of that period to give place
to another equal section.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49"
class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Next,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> it immensely augmented the means of
intimidation possessed by the Four Hundred at home, by exaggerating
the impression of their supposed strength. For the citizens generally
were made to believe that there were five thousand real and living
partners in the conspiracy; while the fact that these partners were
not known and could not be individually identified, rather aggravated
the reigning terror and mistrust; since every man, suspecting
that his neighbor might possibly be among them, was afraid to
communicate his discontent or propose means for joint resistance.<a
id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In
both these two ways, the name and assumed existence of the Five
Thousand lent strength to the real Four Hundred conspirators. It
masked their usurpation, while it increased their hold on the respect
and fears of the citizens.</p>

<p>As soon as the public assembly at Kolônus had, with such seeming
unanimity, accepted all the propositions of Peisander, they were
dismissed; and the new regiment of Four Hundred were chosen and
constituted in the form prescribed. It now only remained to install
them in the senate-house. But this could not be done without force,
since the senators were already within it; having doubtless gone
thither immediately from the assembly, where their presence, at least
the presence of the prytanes, or senators of the presiding tribe,
was essential as legal presidents. They had to deliberate what they
would do under the decree just passed, which divested them of all
authority. Nor was it impossible that they might organize armed
resistance; for which there seemed more than usual facility at the
present moment, since the occupation of Dekeleia by the Lacedæmonians
kept Athens in a condition like that of a permanent camp, with
a large proportion of the citizens day and night under arms.<a
id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Against this chance the Four Hundred made provision. They selected
that hour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span>
the day when the greater number of citizens habitually went home,
probably to their morning meal, leaving the military station, with
the arms piled and ready, under comparatively thin watch. While the
general body of hoplites left the station at this hour, according
to the usual practice, the hoplites—Andrian, Tenian, and others—in
the immediate confidence of the Four Hundred, were directed, by
private order, to hold themselves prepared and in arms, at a little
distance off; so that if any symptoms should appear of resistance
being contemplated, they might at once interfere and forestall it.
Having taken this precaution, the Four Hundred marched in a body
to the senate-house, each man with a dagger concealed under his
garment, and followed by their special body-guard of one hundred and
twenty young men from various Grecian cities, the instruments of
the assassinations ordered by Antiphon and his colleagues. In this
array they marched into the senate-house, where the senators were
assembled, and commanded them to depart; at the same time tendering
to them their pay for all the remainder of the year,—seemingly
about three months or more down to the beginning of Hecatombæon,
the month of new nominations,—during which their functions ought
to have continued. The senators were no way prepared to resist the
decree just passed under the forms of legality with an armed body now
arrived to enforce its execution. They obeyed and departed, each man
as he passed the door receiving the salary tendered to him. That they
should yield obedience to superior force, under the circumstances,
can excite neither censure nor surprise; but that they should accept,
from the hands of the conspirators, this anticipation of an unearned
salary, was a meanness which almost branded them as accomplices, and
dishonored the expiring hour of the last democratical authority.
The Four Hundred now found themselves triumphantly installed in the
senate-house; without the least resistance, either within its walls,
or even without, by any portion of the citizens.<a id="FNanchor_52"
href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Thus perished, or seemed to perish, the democracy of Athens,
after an uninterrupted existence of nearly one hundred years since
the revolution of Kleisthenês. So incredible did it appear that the
numerous, intelligent, and constitutional citizens of Ath<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span>ens should suffer their
liberties to be overthrown by a band of four hundred conspirators,
while the great mass of them not only loved their democracy, but had
arms in their hands to defend it, that even their enemy and neighbor
Agis, at Dekeleia, could hardly imagine the revolution to be a fact
accomplished. We shall see presently that it did not stand,—nor
would it probably have stood, had circumstances even been more
favorable,—but the accomplishment of it at all, is an incident too
extraordinary to be passed over without some words in explanation.</p>

<p>We must remark that the tremendous catastrophe and loss of blood
in Sicily had abated the energy of the Athenian character generally,
but especially had made them despair of their foreign relations; of
the possibility that they could make head against enemies, increased
in number by revolts among their own allies, and farther sustained
by Persian gold. Upon this sentiment of despair is brought to bear
the treacherous delusion of Alkibiadês, offering them the Persian
aid; that is, means of defence and success against foreign enemies,
at the price of their democracy. Reluctantly the people are brought,
but they <i>are</i> brought, to entertain the proposition: and thus
the conspirators gain their first capital point, of familiarizing
the people with the idea of such a change of constitution. The
ulterior success of the conspiracy—when all prospect of Persian
gold, or improved foreign position, was at an end—is due to the
combinations, alike nefarious and skilful, of Antiphon, wielding
and organizing the united strength of the aristocratical classes
at Athens; strength always exceedingly great, but under ordinary
circumstances working in fractions disunited and even reciprocally
hostile to each other,—restrained by the ascendant democratical
institutions,—and reduced to corrupt what it could not overthrow.
Antiphon, about to employ this anti-popular force in one systematic
scheme, and for the accomplishment of a predetermined purpose,
keeps still within the same ostensible constitutional limits. He
raises no open mutiny: he maintains inviolate the cardinal point of
Athenian political morality, respect to the decision of the senate
and political assembly, as well as to constitutional maxims. But he
knows well that the value of these meetings, as political securities,
depends upon entire freedom of speech; and that, if that freedom
be suppressed, the assembly itself becomes a nullity, or rather an
instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> of
positive imposture and mischief. Accordingly, he causes all the
popular orators to be successively assassinated, so that no man
dares to open his mouth on that side; while on the other hand, the
anti-popular speakers are all loud and confident, cheering one
another on, and seeming to represent all the feeling of the persons
present. By thus silencing each individual leader, and intimidating
every opponent from standing forward as spokesman, he extorts the
formal sanction of the assembly and the senate to measures which the
large majority of the citizens detest. That majority, however, are
bound by their own constitutional forms; and when the decision of
these, by whatever means obtained, is against them, they have neither
the inclination nor the courage to resist. In no part of the world
has this sentiment of constitutional duty, and submission to the vote
of a legal majority, been more keenly and universally felt, than it
was among the citizens of democratical Athens.<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Antiphon thus finds
means to employ the constitutional sentiment of Athens as a means of
killing the constitution: the mere empty form, after its vital and
protective efficacy has been abstracted, remains simply as a cheat to
paralyze individual patriotism.</p>

<p>It was this cheat which rendered the Athenians indisposed to stand
forward with arms in defence of that democracy to which they were
attached. Accustomed as they were to unlimited pacific contention
within the bounds of their constitution, they were in the highest
degree averse to anything like armed intestine contention. This
is the natural effect of an established free and equal polity, to
substitute the contests of the tongue for those of the sword, and
sometimes, even to create so extreme a disinclination to the latter,
that if liberty be energetically assailed, the counter-energy
necessary for its defence may probably be found wanting. So difficult
is it for the same people to have both the qualities requisite for
making a free constitution work well in ordinary times, together
with those very different qualities requisite for upholding it
against exceptional dangers and under trying emergencies. None
but an Athenian of extraordinary ability,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> like Antiphon, would have understood
the art of thus making the constitutional feeling of his countrymen
subservient to the success of his conspiracy, and of maintaining
the forms of legal dealing towards assembled and constitutional
bodies, while he violated them in secret and successive stabs
directed against individuals. Political assassination had been
unknown at Athens, as far as our information reaches, since it
was employed, about fifty years before, by the oligarchical party
against Ephialtês, the coadjutor of Periklês.<a id="FNanchor_54"
href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> But this had been an
individual case, and it was reserved for Antiphon and Phrynichus to
organize a band of assassins working systematically, and taking off
a series of leading victims one after the other. As the Macedonian
kings in after-times required the surrender of the popular orators
in a body, so the authors of this conspiracy found the same enemies
to deal with, and adopted another way of getting rid of them; thus
reducing the assembly into a tame and lifeless mass, capable of being
intimidated into giving its collective sanction to measures which its
large majority detested.</p>

<p>As Grecian history has been usually written, we are instructed to
believe that the misfortunes, and the corruption, and the degradation
of the democratical states are brought upon them by the class of
demagogues, of whom Kleon, Hyperbolus, Androklês, etc., stand forth
as specimens. These men are represented as mischief-makers and
revilers, accusing without just cause, and converting innocence into
treason. Now the history of this conspiracy of the Four Hundred
presents to us the other side of the picture. It shows that the
political enemies—against whom the Athenian people were protected
by their democratical institutions, and by the demagogues as living
organs of those institutions—were not fictitious but dangerously
real. It reveals the continued existence of powerful anti-popular
combinations, ready to come together for treasonable purposes when
the moment appeared safe and tempting. It manifests the character and
morality of the leaders, to whom the direction of the anti-popular
force naturally fell. It proves that these leaders, men of uncommon
ability, required nothing more than the extinction or silence of the
dema<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>gogues, to be
enabled to subvert the popular securities and get possession of the
government. We need no better proof to teach us what was the real
function and intrinsic necessity of these demagogues in the Athenian
system, taking them as a class, and apart from the manner in which
individuals among them may have performed their duty. They formed
the vital movement of all that was tutelary and public-spirited in
democracy. Aggressive in respect to official delinquents, they were
defensive in respect to the public and the constitution. If that
anti-popular force, which Antiphon found ready-made, had not been
efficient, at a much earlier moment, in stifling the democracy, it
was because there were demagogues to cry aloud, as well as assemblies
to hear and sustain them. If Antiphon’s conspiracy was successful, it
was because he knew where to aim his blows, so as to strike down the
real enemies of the oligarchy and the real defenders of the people.
I here employ the term demagogues because it is that commonly used
by those who denounce the class of men here under review: the proper
neutral phrase, laying aside odious associations, would be to call
them popular speakers, or opposition speakers. But, by whatever
name they may be called, it is impossible rightly to conceive
their position in Athens, without looking at them in contrast and
antithesis with those anti-popular forces against which they formed
the indispensable barrier, and which come forth into such manifest
and melancholy working under the organizing hands of Antiphon and
Phrynichus.</p>

<p>As soon as the Four Hundred found themselves formally installed
in the senate-house, they divided themselves by lot into separate
prytanies,—probably ten in number, consisting of forty members
each, like the former senate of Five Hundred, in order that the
distribution of the year to which the people were accustomed might
not be disturbed,—and then solemnized their installation by prayer
and sacrifice. They put to death some political enemies, though
not many: they farther imprisoned and banished others, and made
large changes in the administration of affairs, carrying everything
with a strictness and rigor unknown under the old constitution.<a
id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It
seems to have been proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span> among them to pass a vote of restoration to all persons
under sentence of exile. But this was rejected by the majority in
order that Alkibiadês might not be among the number; nor did they
think it expedient, notwithstanding, to pass the law, reserving him
as a special exception.</p>

<p>They farther despatched a messenger to Agis at Dekeleia,
intimating their wish to treat for peace; which, they affirmed, he
ought to be ready to grant to them, now that “the faithless Demos”
was put down. Agis, however, not believing that the Athenian people
would thus submit to be deprived of their liberty, anticipated that
intestine dissension would certainly break out, or at least that some
portion of the Long Walls would be found unguarded, should a foreign
army appear. While therefore he declined the overtures for peace,
he at the same time sent for reinforcements out of Peloponnesus,
and marched with a considerable army, in addition to his own
garrison, up to the very walls of Athens. But he found the ramparts
carefully manned: no commotion took place within: even a sally was
made, in which some advantage was gained over him. He therefore
speedily retired, sending back his newly-arrived reinforcements to
Peloponnesus; while the Four Hundred, on renewing their advances
to him for peace, now found themselves much better received,
and were even encouraged to despatch envoys to Sparta itself.<a
id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>As soon as they had thus got over the first difficulties, and
placed matters on a footing which seemed to promise stability, they
despatched ten envoys to Samos. Aware beforehand of the danger
impending over them in that quarter from the known aversion of the
soldiers and seamen to anything in the nature of oligarchy, they had,
moreover, just heard, by the arrival of Chæreas and the paralus,
of the joint attack made by the Athenian and Samian oligarchs, and
of its complete failure. Had this event occurred a little earlier,
it might perhaps have deterred even some of their own number from
proceeding with the revolution at Athens, which was rendered
thereby almost sure of failure, from the first. Their ten envoys
were instructed to represent at Samos that the recent oligarchy had
been established with no views injurious to the city, but on the
contrary for the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p.
45]</span> benefit; that though the Council now installed consisted
of Four Hundred only, yet the total number of partisans who had
made the revolution, and were qualified citizens under it, was
Five Thousand; a number greater, they added, than had ever been
actually assembled in the Pnyx under the democracy, even for the
most important debates,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in consequence of the unavoidable absences
of numerous individuals on military service and foreign travel.</p>

<p>What satisfaction might have been given, by this allusion to the
fictitious Five Thousand, or by the fallacious reference to the
numbers, real or pretended, of the past democratical assemblies,
had these envoys carried to Samos the first tidings of the Athenian
revolution, we cannot say. They were forestalled by Chæreas, the
officer of the paralus; who, though the Four Hundred tried to detain
him, made his escape and hastened to Samos to communicate the
fearful and unexpected change which had occurred at Athens. Instead
of hearing that change described under the treacherous extenuations
prescribed by Antiphon and Phrynichus, the armament first learned it
from the lips of Chæreas, who told them at once the extreme truth,
and even more than the truth. He recounted, with indignation, that
every Athenian who ventured to say a word against the Four Hundred
rulers of the city, was punished with the scourge; that even the
wives and children of persons hostile to them were outraged; that
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> was a design
of seizing and imprisoning the relatives of the democrats at Samos,
and putting them to death, if the latter refused to obey orders from
Athens. The simple narrative of what had really occurred would have
been quite sufficient to provoke in the armament a sentiment of
detestation against the Four Hundred. But these additional details
of Chæreas, partly untrue, filled them with uncontrollable wrath,
which they manifested by open menace against the known partisans of
the Four Hundred at Samos, as well as against those who had taken
part in the recent oligarchical conspiracy in the island. It was
not without difficulty that their hands were arrested by the more
reflecting citizens present, who remonstrated against the madness of
such disorderly proceedings when the enemy was close upon them.</p>

<p>But though violence and aggressive insult were thus seasonably
checked, the sentiment of the armament was too ardent and unanimous
to be satisfied without some solemn, emphatic, and decisive
declaration against the oligarchs at Athens. A great democratical
manifestation, of the most earnest and imposing character, was
proclaimed, chiefly at the instance of Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus.
The Athenian armament, brought together in one grand assembly, took
an oath by the most stringent sanctions: to maintain their democracy;
to keep up friendship and harmony with each other; to carry on the
war against the Peloponnesians with energy; to be at enmity with the
Four Hundred at Athens, and to enter into no amicable communication
with them whatever. The whole armament swore to this compact
with enthusiasm, and even those who had before taken part in the
oligarchical movements were forced to be forward in the ceremony.<a
id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> What
lent double force to this touching scene was, that the entire Samian
pop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>ulation, every
male of the military age, took the oath along with the friendly
armament. Both pledged themselves to mutual fidelity and common
suffering or triumph, whatever might be the issue of the contest.
Both felt that the Peloponnesians at Milêtus, and the Four Hundred
at Athens, were alike their enemies, and that the success of either
would be their common ruin.</p>

<p>Pursuant to this resolution,—of upholding their democracy and at
the same time sustaining the war against the Peloponnesians, at all
cost or peril to themselves,—the soldiers of the armament now took
a step unparalleled in Athenian history. Feeling that they could no
longer receive orders from Athens under her present oligarchical
rulers, with whom Charmînus and others among their own leaders were
implicated, they constituted themselves into a sort of community
apart, and held an assembly as citizens to choose anew their generals
and trierarchs. Of those already in command, several were deposed as
unworthy of trust; others being elected in their places, especially
Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. Nor was the assembly held for election
alone; it was a scene of effusive sympathy, animating eloquence, and
patriotism generous as well as resolute. The united armament felt
that <i>they</i> were the real Athens; the guardians of her constitution,
the upholders of her remaining empire and glory, the protectors of
her citizens at home against those conspirators who had intruded
themselves wrongfully into the senate-house; the sole barrier, even
for those conspirators themselves, against the hostile Peloponnesian
fleet. “<i>The city has revolted from us</i>,” exclaimed Thrasybulus and
others in pregnant words, which embodied a whole train of feeling.<a
id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
“But let not this abate our courage: for they are only the lesser
force, we are the greater and the self-sufficing. We have here the
whole navy of the state, whereby we can insure to ourselves the
contributions from our dependencies just as well as if we started
from Athens. We have the hearty attachment of Samos, second in power
only to Athens herself, and serving us as a military station against
the enemy, now as in the past. We are better able to obtain supplies
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span> ourselves, than
those in the city for themselves; for it is only through our presence
at Samos that they have hitherto kept the mouth of Peiræus open. If
they refuse to restore to us our democratical constitution, we shall
be better able to exclude them from the sea than they to exclude
us. What, indeed, does the city do now for us to second our efforts
against the enemy? Little or nothing. We have lost nothing by their
separation. They send us no pay, they leave us to provide maintenance
for ourselves; they are now out of condition for sending us even good
counsel, which is the great superiority of a city over a camp.<a
id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
As counsellors, we here are better than they; for they have just
committed the wrong of subverting the constitution of our common
country, while we are striving to maintain it, and will do our best
to force them into the same track. Alkibiadês, if we insure to him
a safe restoration, will cheerfully bring the alliance of Persia to
sustain us; and, even if the worst comes to the worst, if all other
hopes fail us, our powerful naval force will always enable us to find
places of refuge in abundance, with city and territory adequate to
our wants.”</p>

<p>Such was the encouraging language of Thrasyllus and Thrasybulus,
which found full sympathy in the armament, and raised among them
a spirit of energetic patriotism and resolution, not unworthy of
their forefathers when refugees at Salamis under the invasion of
Xerxês. To regain their democracy and to sustain the war against the
Peloponnesians, were impulses alike ardent and blended in the same
tide of generous enthusiasm; a tide so vehement as to sweep before
it the reluctance of that minority who had before been inclined to
the oligarchical movement. But besides these two impulses, there was
also a third, tending towards the recall of Alkibiadês; a coadjutor,
if in many ways useful, yet bringing with him a spirit of selfishness
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span> duplicity
uncongenial to the exalted sentiment now all-powerful at Samos.<a
id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>This exile had been the first to originate the oligarchical
conspiracy, whereby Athens, already scarcely adequate to the
exigencies of her foreign war, was now paralyzed in courage and
torn by civil discord, preserved from absolute ruin only by that
counter-enthusiasm which a fortunate turn of circumstances had raised
up at Samos. Having at first duped the conspirators themselves,
and enabled them to dupe the sincere democrats, by promising
Persian aid, and thus floating the plot over its first and greatest
difficulties,—Alkibiadês had found himself constrained to break
with them as soon as the time came for realizing his promises. But
he had broken off with so much address as still to keep up the
illusion that he <i>could</i> realize them if he chose. His return by
means of the oligarchy being now impossible, he naturally became
its enemy, and this new antipathy superseded his feeling of revenge
against the democracy for having banished him. In fact he was
disposed, as Phrynichus had truly said about him,<a id="FNanchor_62"
href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to avail himself
indifferently of either, according as the one or the other presented
itself as a serviceable agency for his ambitious views. Accordingly,
as soon as the turn of affairs at Samos had made itself manifest, he
opened communication with Thrasybulus and the democratical leaders,<a
id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
renewing to them the same promises of Persian alliance, on condition
of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span> own
restoration, as he had before made to Peisander and the oligarchical
party. Thrasybulus and his colleagues either sincerely believed him,
or at least thought that his restoration afforded a possibility,
not to be neglected, of obtaining Persian aid, without which they
despaired of the war. Such possibility would at least infuse spirit
into the soldiers; while the restoration was now proposed without the
terrible condition which had before accompanied it, of renouncing the
democratical constitution.</p>

<p>It was not without difficulty, however, nor until after more than
one assembly and discussion,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that Thrasybulus prevailed on the armament
to pass a vote of security and restoration to Alkibiadês. As Athenian
citizens, the soldiers probably were unwilling to take upon them the
reversal of a sentence solemnly passed by the democratical tribunal,
on the ground of irreligion with suspicion of treason. They were,
however, induced to pass the vote, after which Thrasybulus sailed
over to the Asiatic coast, brought across Alkibiadês to the island,
and introduced him to the assembled armament. The supple exile, who
had denounced the democracy so bitterly, both at Sparta, and in his
correspondence with the oligarchical conspirators, knew well how to
adapt himself to the sympathies of the democratical assembly now
before him. He began by deploring the sentence of banishment passed
against him, and throwing the blame of it, not upon the injustice of
his countrymen, but upon his own unhappy destiny.<a id="FNanchor_65"
href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> He then entered
upon the public prospects of the moment, pledging himself with
entire confidence to realize the hopes of Persian alliance, and
boasting, in terms not merely ostentatious but even extravagant, of
the ascendant influence which he possessed over Tissaphernês. The
satrap had promised him, so the speech went<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span> on, never to let the Athenians want for
pay, as soon as he once came to trust them, not even if it were
necessary to issue out his last daric or to coin his own silver couch
into money. Nor would he require any farther condition to induce him
to trust them, except that Alkibiadês should be restored and should
become their guarantee. Not only would he furnish the Athenians with
pay, but he would, besides, bring up to their aid the Phenician
fleet, which was already at Aspendus, instead of placing it at the
disposal of the Peloponnesians.</p>

<p>In the communications of Alkibiadês with Peisander and his
coadjutors, Alkibiadês had pretended that the Great King could
have no confidence in the Athenians unless they not only restored
him, but abnegated their democracy. On this occasion, the latter
condition was withdrawn, and the confidence of the Great King
was said to be more easily accorded. But though Alkibiadês thus
presented himself with a new falsehood, as well as with a new vein
of political sentiment, his discourse was eminently successful. It
answered all the various purposes which he contemplated; partly of
intimidating and disuniting the oligarchical conspirators at home,
partly of exalting his own grandeur in the eyes of the armament,
partly of sowing mistrust between the Spartans and Tissaphernês.
It was in such full harmony with both the reigning feelings of the
armament,—eagerness to put down the Four Hundred, as well as to get
the better of their Peloponnesian enemies in Ionia,—that the hearers
were not disposed to scrutinize narrowly the grounds upon which his
assurances rested. In the fulness of confidence and enthusiasm, they
elected him general along with Thrasybulus and the rest, conceiving
redoubled hopes of victory over their enemies both at Athens and
at Milêtus. So completely, indeed, were their imaginations filled
with the prospect of Persian aid, against their enemies in Ionia,
that alarm for the danger of Athens under the government of the Four
Hundred became the predominant feeling; and many voices were even
raised in favor of sailing to Peiræus for the rescue of the city. But
Alkibiadês, knowing well—what the armament did not know—that his own
promises of Persian pay and fleet were a mere delusion, strenuously
dissuaded such a movement, which would have left the dependencies in
Ionia defenceless against the Peloponnesians. As soon as the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span> assembly broke up, he
crossed over again to the mainland, under pretence of concerting
measures with Tissaphernês to realize his recent engagements.</p>

<p>Relieved substantially, though not in strict form, from the
penalties of exile, Alkibiadês was thus launched in a new career.
After having first played the game of Athens against Sparta, next,
that of Sparta against Athens, thirdly, that of Tissaphernês
against both, he now professed to take up again the promotion of
Athenian interests. In reality, however, he was and had always been
playing his own game, or obeying his own self-interest, ambition,
or antipathy. He was at this time eager to make a show of intimate
and confidential communication with Tissaphernês, in order that he
might thereby impose upon the Athenians at Samos, to communicate to
the satrap his recent election as general of the Athenian force,
that his importance with the Persians might be enhanced, and
lastly, by passing backwards and forwards from Tissaphernês to the
Athenian camp, to exhibit an appearance of friendly concert between
the two, which might sow mistrust and alarm in the minds of the
Peloponnesians. In this tripartite manœuvring, so suitable to his
habitual character, he was more or less successful, especially in
regard to the latter purpose. For though he never had any serious
chance of inducing Tissaphernês to assist the Athenians, he did,
nevertheless, contribute to alienate him from the enemy, as well
as the enemy from him.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Without any longer delay in the camp of Tissaphernês than was
necessary to keep up the faith of the Athenians in his promise of
Persian aid, Alkibiadês returned to Samos, where he was found by
the ten envoys sent by the Four Hundred from Athens, on their first
arrival. These envoys had been long in their voyage; having made a
considerable stay at Delos, under alarm from intelligence of the
previous visit of Chæreas, and the furious indignation which his
narrative had provoked.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> At length they reached Samos, and were
invited by the generals to make their communication to the assembled
armament. They had the utmost difficulty in procuring a hearing,
so strong was the antipathy against them, so loud were the cries
that the subverters of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p.
53]</span> democracy ought to be put to death. Silence being at
length obtained, they proceeded to state that the late revolution
had been brought to pass for the salvation of the city, and
especially for the economy of the public treasure, by suppressing
the salaried civil functions of the democracy, and thus leaving
more pay for the soldiers;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a> that there was no purpose of mischief in
the change, still less of betrayal to the enemy, which might already
have been effected, had such been the intention of the Four Hundred,
when Agis advanced from Dekeleia up to the walls; that the citizens
now possessing the political franchise, were not Four Hundred only,
but Five Thousand in number, all of whom would take their turn
in rotation for the places now occupied by the Four Hundred;<a
id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> that
the recitals of Chæreas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p.
54]</span> affirming ill-usage to have been offered to the relatives
of the soldiers at Athens, were utterly false and calumnious.</p>

<p>Such were the topics on which the envoys insisted, in an
apologetic strain, at considerable length, but without any effect
in conciliating the soldiers who heard them. The general resentment
against the Four Hundred was expressed by several persons present
in public speech, by others in private manifestation of feeling
against the envoys: and so passionately was this sentiment
aggravated,—consisting not only of wrath for what the oligarchy had
done, but of fear for what they might do,—that the proposition of
sailing immediately to the Peiræus was revived with greater ardor
than before. Alkibiadês, who had already once discountenanced this
design, now stood forward to repel it again. Nevertheless, all the
plenitude of his influence, then greater than that of any other
officer in the armament, and seconded by the esteemed character
as well as the loud voice of Thrasybulus,<a id="FNanchor_70"
href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> was required to avert
it. But for him, it would have been executed. While he reproved and
silenced those who were most clamorous against the envoys, he took
upon himself to give to the latter a public answer in the name of the
collective armament. “We make no objection (he said) to the power of
the Five Thousand: but the Four Hundred must go about their business,
and reinstate the senate of Five Hundred as it was before. We are
much obliged for what you have done in the way of economy, so as to
increase the pay available for the soldiers. Above all, maintain the
war strenuously, without any flinching before the enemy. For if the
city be now safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>
held, there is good hope that we may make up the mutual differences
between us by amicable settlement; but if once either of us perish,
either we here or you at home, there will be nothing left for the
other to make up with.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>With this reply he dismissed the envoys; the armament reluctantly
abandoning their wish of sailing to Athens. Thucydidês insists much
on the capital service which Alkibiadês then rendered to his country,
by arresting a project which would have had the effect of leaving
all Ionia and the Hellespont defenceless against the Peloponnesians.
His advice doubtless turned out well in the result; yet if we
contemplate the state of affairs at the moment when he gave it, we
shall be inclined to doubt whether prudential calculation was not
rather against him, and in favor of the impulse of the armament.
For what was to hinder the Four Hundred from patching up a peace
with Sparta, and getting a Lacedæmonian garrison into Athens to
help them in maintaining their dominion? Even apart from ambition,
this was their best chance, if not their only chance, of safety for
themselves; and we shall presently see that they tried to do it;
being prevented from succeeding, partly, indeed, by the mutiny which
arose against them at Athens, but still more by the stupidity of the
Lacedæmonians themselves. Alkibiadês could not really imagine that
the Four Hundred would obey his mandate delivered to the envoys,
and resign their power voluntarily. But if they remained masters of
Athens, who could calculate what they would do,—after having received
this declaration of hostility from Samos,—not merely in regard to
the foreign enemy, but even in regard to the relatives of the absent
soldiers? Whether we look to the legitimate apprehensions of the
soldiers, inevitable while their relatives were thus exposed, and
almost unnerving them as to the hearty prosecution of the war abroad,
in their utter uncertainty with regard to matters at home,—or to the
chance of irreparable public calamity, greater even than the loss of
Ionia, by the betrayal of Athens to the enemy,—we shall be disposed
to con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>clude
that the impulse of the armament was not merely natural, but even
founded on a more prudent estimate of the actual chances, and that
Alkibiadês was nothing more than fortunate in a sanguine venture.
And if, instead of the actual chances, we look to the chances as
Alkibiadês represented, and as the armament conceived them upon his
authority,—namely, that the Phenician fleet was close at hand to act
against the Lacedæmonians in Ionia,—we shall sympathize yet more with
the defensive movement homeward. Alkibiadês had an advantage over
every one else, simply by knowing his own falsehoods.</p>

<p>At the same assembly were introduced envoys from Argos, bearing
a mission of recognition and an offer of aid to the Athenian Demos
in Samos. They came in an Athenian trireme, navigated by the parali
who had brought home Chæreas in the paralus from Samos to Athens,
and had been then transferred into a common ship of war and sent to
cruise about Eubœa. Since that time, however, they had been directed
to convey Læspodias, Aristophon, and Melêsias,<a id="FNanchor_72"
href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> as ambassadors from the
Four Hundred to Sparta. But when crossing the Argolic gulf, probably
under orders to land at Prasiæ, they declared against the oligarchy,
sailed to Argos, and there deposited as prisoners the three
ambassadors, who had all been active in the conspiracy of the Four
Hundred. Being then about to depart for Samos, they were requested
by the Argeians to carry thither their envoys, who were dismissed
by Alkibiadês with an expression of gratitude, and with a hope that
their aid would be ready when called for.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the envoys returned from Samos to Athens, carrying back
to the Four Hundred the unwelcome news of their total failure with
the armament. A little before, it appears, some of the trierarchs on
service at the Hellespont had returned to Athens also,—Eratosthenês,
Iatroklês, and others, who had tried to turn their squadron to the
purposes of the oligarchical conspirators, but had been baffled
and driven off by the inflexible democracy of their own seamen.<a
id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
If at Athens, the calculations of these<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> conspirators had succeeded more
triumphantly than could have been expected beforehand, everywhere
else they had completely miscarried; not merely at Samos and in
the fleet, but also with the allied dependencies. At the time when
Peisander quitted Samos for Athens, to consummate the oligarchical
conspiracy even without Alkibiadês, he and others had gone round
many of the dependencies and had effected a similar revolution in
their internal government, in hopes that they would thus become
attached to the new oligarchy at Athens. But this anticipation, as
Phrynichus had predicted, was nowhere realized. The newly-created
oligarchies only became more anxious for complete autonomy than
the democracies had been before. At Thasos, especially, a body of
exiles who had for some time dwelt in Peloponnesus were recalled,
and active preparations were made for revolt, by new fortifications
as well as by new triremes.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Instead of strengthening their hold on the
maritime empire, the Four Hundred thus found that they had actually
weakened it; while the pronounced hostility of the armament at Samos,
not only put an end to all their hopes abroad, but rendered their
situation at home altogether precarious.</p>

<p>From the moment when the coadjutors of Antiphon first learned,
through the arrival of Chæreas at Athens, the proclamation of the
democracy at Samos, discord, mistrust, and alarm began to spread
even among their own members; together with a conviction that
the oligarchy could never stand except through the presence of a
Peloponnesian garrison in Athens. While Antiphon and Phrynichus,
the leading minds who directed the majority of the Four Hundred,
despatched envoys to Sparta for concluding peace,—these envoys never
reached Sparta, being seized by the parali and sent prisoners to
Argos, as above stated—, and commenced the erection of a special fort
at Ectioneia, the projecting mole which contracted and commanded,
on the northern side, the narrow entrance of Peiræus, there began
to arise even in the bosom of the Four Hundred an opposition
minority affect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span>ing
popular sentiment, among whom the most conspicuous persons were
Theramenês and Aristokratês.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Though these men had stood forward prominently as contrivers and
actors throughout the whole progress of the conspiracy, they now
found themselves bitterly disappointed by the result. Individually,
their ascendency with their colleagues was inferior to that of
Peisander, Kallæschrus, Phrynichus, and others; while, collectively,
the ill-gotten power of the Four Hundred was diminished in value, as
much as it was aggravated in peril, by the loss of the foreign empire
and the alienation of their Samian armament. Now began the workings
of jealousy and strife among the successful conspirators, each of
whom had entered into the scheme with unbounded expectations of
personal ambition for himself, each had counted on stepping at once
into the first place among the new oligarchical body. In a democracy,
observes Thucydidês, contentions for power and preëminence provoke in
the unsuccessful competitors less of fierce antipathy and sense of
injustice, than in an oligarchy; for the losing candidates acquiesce
with comparatively little repugnance in the unfavorable vote of a
large miscellaneous body of unknown citizens; but they are angry at
being put aside by a few known comrades, their rivals as well as
their equals: moreover, at the moment when an oligarchy of ambitious
men has just raised itself on the ruins of a democracy, every man
of the conspirators is in exaggerated expectation; every one thinks
himself entitled to become at once the first man of the body, and
is dissatisfied if he be merely put upon a level with the rest.<a
id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span></p> <p>Such
were the feelings of disappointed ambition, mingled with despondency,
which sprung up among a minority of the Four<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span> Hundred, immediately after the news
of the proclamation of the democracy at Samos among the armament.
Theramenês, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span>
leader of this minority,—a man of keen ambition, clever but unsteady
and treacherous, not less ready to desert his party than to betray
his country, though less prepared for extreme atrocities than many
of his oligarchical comrades, began to look out for a good pretence
to disconnect himself from a precarious enterprise. Taking advantage
of the delusion which the Four Hundred had themselves held out
about the fictitious Five Thousand, he insisted that, since the
dangers that beset the newly-formed authority were so much more
formidable than had been anticipated, it was necessary to popularize
the party by enrolling and producing these Five Thousand as a real
instead of a fictitious body.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Such an opposition, formidable from
the very outset, became still bolder and more developed when the
envoys returned from Samos, with an account of their reception
by the armament, as well as of the answer, delivered in the name
of the armament, whereby Alkibiadês directed the Four Hundred to
dissolve themselves forthwith, but at the same time approved of the
constitution of the Five Thousand, coupled with the restoration
of the old senate. To enroll the Five Thousand at once, would be
meeting the army half way; and there were hopes that, at that
price, a compromise and reconciliation might be effected, of which
Alkibiadês had himself spoken as practicable.<a id="FNanchor_78"
href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In addition to the
formal answer, the envoys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p.
62]</span> doubtless brought back intimation of the enraged feelings
manifested by the armament, and of their eagerness, uncontrollable by
every one except Alkibiadês, to sail home forthwith and rescue Athens
from the Four Hundred. Hence arose an increased conviction that the
dominion of the latter could not last: and an ambition, on the part
of others as well as Theramenês, to stand forward as leaders of a
popular opposition against it, in the name of the Five Thousand.<a
id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Against this popular opposition, Antiphon and Phrynichus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span> exerted themselves, with
demagogic assiduity, to caress and keep together the majority of the
Four Hundred, as well as to uphold their power without abridgment.
They were noway disposed to comply with this requisition that the
fiction of the Five Thousand should be converted into a reality. They
knew well that the enrollment of so many partners<a id="FNanchor_80"
href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> would be tantamount to
a democracy, and would be, in substance at least, if not in form, an
annihilation of their own power. They had now gone too far to recede
with safety; while the menacing attitude of Samos, as well as the
opposition growing up against them at home, both within and without
their own body, served only as instigation to them to accelerate
their measures for peace with Sparta, and to secure the introduction
of a Spartan garrison.</p>

<p>With this view, immediately after the return of their envoys
from Samos, the two most eminent leaders, Antiphon and Phrynichus,
went themselves with ten other colleagues in all haste to Sparta,
prepared to purchase peace and the promise of Spartan aid almost
at any price. At the same time, the construction of the fortress
at Ectioneia was prosecuted with redoubled zeal; under pretence of
defending the entrance of Peiræus against the armament from Samos,
if the threat of their coming should be executed, but with the real
purpose of bringing into it a Lacedæmonian fleet and army. For this
latter object every facility was provided. The northwestern corner
of the fortification of Peiræus, to the north of the harbor and its
mouth, was cut off by a cross wall reaching southward so as to join
the harbor: from the southern end of this cross wall, and forming an
angle with it, a new wall was built, fronting the harbor and running
to the extremity of the mole which narrowed the mouth of the harbor
on the northern side, at which mole it met the termination of the
northern wall of Peiræus. A separate citadel was thus inclosed,
defensible against any attack either from Peiræus or from the harbor;
furnished, besides, with distinct broad gates and posterns of its
own, as well as with facilities for admitting an enemy with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span>in it.<a id="FNanchor_81"
href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The new cross wall
was carried so as to traverse a vast portico, or open market-house,
the largest in Peiræus: the larger half of this portico thus became
inclosed within the new citadel; and orders were issued that all
the corn, both actually warehoused and hereafter to be imported
into Peiræus, should be deposited therein and sold out from thence
for consumption. As Athens was sustained almost exclusively on corn
brought from Eubœa and elsewhere, since the permanent occupation
of Dekeleia, the Four Hundred rendered themselves masters by this
arrangement of all the subsistence of the citizens, as well as of the
entrance into the harbor; either to admit the Spartans or exclude
the armament from Samos.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Though Theramenês, himself one of the generals named under the
Four Hundred, denounced, in conjunction with his supporters, the
treasonable purpose of this new citadel, yet the majority of the
Four Hundred stood to their resolution, and the building made rapid
progress under the superintendence of the general Alexiklês, one of
the most strenuous of the oligarchical faction.<a id="FNanchor_83"
href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Such was the habit
of obedience at Athens to an established authority, when once
constituted,—and so great the fear and mistrust arising out of
the general belief in the reality of the Five Thousand unknown
auxiliaries, supposed to be prepared to enforce the orders of the
Four Hundred,—that the people, and even armed citizen hoplites,
went on working at the building, in spite of their suspicions as to
its design. Though not completed, it was so far advanced as to be
defensible, when Antiphon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p.
65]</span> Phrynichus returned from Sparta. They had gone thither
prepared to surrender everything,—not merely their naval force,
but their city itself,—and to purchase their own personal safety
by making the Lacedæmonians masters of Peiræus.<a id="FNanchor_84"
href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Yet we read with
astonishment that the latter could not be prevailed on to contract
any treaty, and that they manifested nothing but backwardness in
seizing this golden opportunity. Had Alkibiadês been now playing
their game, as he had been doing a year earlier, immediately before
the revolt of Chios,—had they been under any energetic leaders, to
impel them into hearty coöperation with the treason of the Four
Hundred, who combined at this moment both the will and the power to
place Athens in their hands, if seconded by an adequate force,—they
might now have overpowered their great enemy at home, before the
armament at Samos could have been brought to the rescue.</p>

<p>Considering that Athens was saved from capture only by the
slackness and stupidity of the Spartans, we may see that the armament
at Samos had reasonable excuse for their eagerness previously
manifested to come home; and that Alkibiadês, in combating that
intention, braved an extreme danger which nothing but incredible
good fortune averted. Why the Lacedæmonians remained idle, both
in Peloponnesus and at Dekeleia, while Athens was thus betrayed,
and in the very throes of dissolution, we can render no account:
possibly, the caution of the ephors may have distrusted Antiphon
and Phrynichus, from the mere immensity of their concessions.
All that they would promise was, that a Lacedæmonian fleet of
forty-two triremes, partly from Tarentum and Lokri, now about
to start from Las in the Laconian gulf, and to sail to Eubœa on
the invitation of a disaffected party in that island, should so
far depart from its straight course as to hover near Ægina and
Peiræus, ready to take advantage of any opportunity for attack laid
open by the Four Hundred.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span></p>

<p id="Phry">Of this squadron, however, even before it rounded Cape
Malea, Theramenês obtained intelligence, and denounced it as intended
to operate in concert with the Four Hundred for the occupation
of Ectioneia. Meanwhile Athens became daily a scene of greater
discontent and disorder, after the abortive embassy and return from
Sparta of Antiphon and Phrynichus. The coercive ascendency of the
Four Hundred was silently disappearing, while the hatred which their
usurpation had inspired, together with the fear of their traitorous
concert with the public enemy, became more and more loudly manifested
in men’s private conversations as well as in gatherings secretly
got together within numerous houses; especially the house of the
peripolarch, the captain of the peripoli, or youthful hoplites,
who formed the chief police of the country. Such hatred was not
long in passing from vehement passion into act. Phrynichus, as he
left the senate-house, was assassinated by two confederates, one of
them a peripolus, or youthful hoplite, in the midst of the crowded
market-place and in full daylight. The man who struck the blow made
his escape, but his comrade was seized and put to the torture by
order of the Four Hundred:<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> he was however a stranger, from Argos,
and either could not or would not reveal the name of any directing
accomplice. Nothing was obtained from him except general indications
of meetings and wide-spread disaffection. Nor did the Four Hundred,
being thus left without special evidence, dare to lay hands upon
Theramenês, the pronounced leader of the opposition, as we shall
find Kritias doing six years afterwards, under the rule of the
Thirty. The assassins of Phrynichus remaining undiscovered and
unpunished, Theramenês and his associates became bolder in their
opposition than before. And the approach of the Lacedæmonian fleet
under Agesandridas,—which, having now taken station at Epidaurus,
had made a descent on Ægina, and was hovering not far off Peiræus,
altogether out of the straight course for Eubœa,—lent double<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> force to all their
previous assertions about the imminent dangers connected with the
citadel at Ectioneia.</p>

<p>Amidst this exaggerated alarm and discord, the general body
of hoplites became penetrated with aversion,<a id="FNanchor_87"
href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> every day increasing,
against the new citadel. At length the hoplites of the tribe in which
Aristokratês, the warmest partisan of Theramenês was taxiarch, being
on duty and engaged in the prosecution of the building, broke out
into absolute mutiny against it, seized the person of Alexiklês,
the general in command, and put him under arrest in a neighboring
house; while the peripoli, or youthful military police, stationed
at Munychia, under Hermon, abetted them in the proceeding.<a
id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> News
of this violence was speedily conveyed to the Four Hundred, who
were at that moment holding session in the senate-house, Theramenês
himself being present. Their wrath and menace were at first vented
against him as the instigator of the revolt, a charge against which
he could only vindicate himself by volunteering to go among the
foremost for the liberation of the prisoner. He forthwith started
in haste for the Peiræus, accompanied by one of the generals, his
colleague, who was of the same political sentiment as himself. A
third among the generals, Aristarchus, one of the fiercest of the
oligarchs, followed him, probably from mistrust, together with some
of the younger knights, horsemen, or richest class in the state,
identified with the cause of the Four Hundred. The oligarchical
partisans ran to marshal themselves in arms, alarming exaggerations
being rumored, that Alexiklês had been put to death, and that Peiræus
was under armed occupation; while at Peiræus the insurgents imagined
that the hoplites from the city were in full march to attack them.
For a time all was confusion and angry sentiment, which the slightest
untoward accident might have inflamed into sanguinary civil carnage.
Nor was it appeased except by earnest intreaty and remonstrance from
the elder citizens, aided by Thucydidês of Pharsalus, proxenus or
public guest of Athens, in his native town, on the ruinous madness of
such discord when a foreign enemy was almost at their gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span></p>

<p>The perilous excitement of this temporary crisis, which brought
into full daylight every man’s real political sentiments, proved
the oligarchical faction, hitherto exaggerated in number, to be far
less powerful than had been imagined by their opponents. And the
Four Hundred had found themselves too much embarrassed how to keep
up the semblance of their authority even in Athens itself, to be
able to send down any considerable force for the protection of their
citadel at Ectioneia; though they were reinforced, only eight days
before their fall, by at least one supplementary member, probably
in substitution for some predecessor who had accidentally died.<a
id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Theramenês, on reaching Peiræus, began to address the mutinous
hoplites in a tone of simulated displeasure, while Aristarchus
and his oligarchical companions spoke in the harshest language,
and threatened them with the force which they imagined to be
presently coming down from the city. But these menaces were met by
equal firmness on the part of the hoplites, who even appealed to
Theramenês himself, and called upon him to say whether he thought
the construction of this citadel was for the good of Athens, or
whether it would not be better demolished. His opinion had been fully
pronounced beforehand; and he replied, that if they thought proper to
demolish it, he cordially concurred. Without farther delay, hoplites
and unarmed people mounted pell-mell upon the walls, and commenced
the demolition with alacrity; under the general shout, “Whoever is
for the Five Thousand in place of the Four Hundred, let him lend a
hand in this work.” The idea of the old democracy was in every one’s
mind, but no man uttered the word; the fear of the imaginary Five
Thousand still continuing. The work of demolition seems to have been
prosecuted all that day, and not to have been completed until the
next day; after which the hoplites released Alexiklês from arrest,
without doing him any injury.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90"
class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span></p>

<p>Two things deserve notice, among these details, as illustrating
the Athenian character. Though Alexiklês was vehemently oligarchical
as well as unpopular, these mutineers do no harm to his person, but
content themselves with putting him under arrest. Next, they do not
venture to commence the actual demolition of the citadel, until
they have the formal sanction of Theramenês, one of the constituted
generals. The strong habit of legality, implanted in all Athenian
citizens by their democracy,—and the care, even in departing from it,
to depart as little as possible,—stand plainly evidenced in these
proceedings.</p>

<p>The events of this day gave a fatal shock to the ascendency of
the Four Hundred; yet they assembled on the morrow as usual in
the senate-house; and they appear now, when it was too late, to
have directed one of their members to draw up a real list, giving
body to the fiction of the Five Thousand.<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Meanwhile the hoplites
in Peiræus, having finished the levelling of the new fortifications,
took the still more important step of entering, armed as they were,
into the theatre of Dionysus hard by, in Peiræus, but on the verge
of Munychia, and there holding a formal assembly; probably under
the convocation of the general Theramenês, pursuant to the forms of
the anterior democracy. They here took the resolution of adjourning
their assembly to the Anakeion, or temple of Castor and Pollux, the
Dioskuri, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> the
city itself and close under the acropolis; whither they immediately
marched and established themselves, still retaining their arms. So
much was the position of the Four Hundred changed, that they who had
on the preceding day been on the aggressive against a spontaneous
outburst of mutineers in Peiræus, were now thrown upon the defensive
against a formal assembly, all armed, in the city, and close by
their own senate-house. Feeling themselves too weak to attempt any
force, they sent deputies to the Anakeion to negotiate and offer
concessions. They engaged to publish the list of <i>The</i> Five Thousand,
and to convene them for the purpose of providing for the periodical
cessation and renewal of the Four Hundred, by rotation from the Five
Thousand, in such order as the latter themselves should determine.
But they entreated that time might be allowed for effecting this, and
that internal peace might be maintained, without which there was no
hope of defence against the enemy without. Many of the hoplites in
the city itself joined the assembly in the Anakeion, and took part
in the debates. The position of the Four Hundred being no longer
such as to inspire fear, the tongues of speakers were now again
loosed, and the ears of the multitude again opened, for the first
time since the arrival of Peisander from Samos, with the plan of the
oligarchical conspiracy. Such renewal of free and fearless public
speech, the peculiar life-principle of the democracy, was not less
wholesome in tranquillizing intestine discord than in heightening
the sentiment of common patriotism against the foreign enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The
assembly at length dispersed, after naming an early future time for
a second assembly, to bring about the reëstablishment of harmony
in the theatre of Dionysus.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>On the day, and at the hour, when this assembly in the theatre
of Dionysus was on the point of coming together, the news ran<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span> through Peiræus
and Athens, that the forty-two triremes under the Lacedæmonian
Agesandridas, having recently quitted the harbor of Megara, were
sailing along the coast of Salamis in the direction towards Peiræus.
Such an event, while causing universal consternation throughout the
city, confirmed all the previous warnings of Theramenês as to the
treasonable destination of the citadel recently demolished, and every
one rejoiced that the demolition had been accomplished just in time.
Foregoing their intended assembly, the citizens rushed with one
accord down to Peiræus, where some of them took post to garrison the
walls and the mouth of the harbor; others got aboard the triremes
lying in the harbor: others, again, launched some fresh triremes from
the boat-houses into the water. Agesandridas rowed along the shore,
near the mouth of Peiræus; but found nothing to promise concert
within, or tempt him to the intended attack. Accordingly, he passed
by and moved onward to Sunium, in a southerly direction. Having
doubled the Cape of Sunium, he then turned his course along the coast
of Attica northward, halted for a little while between Thorikus and
Prasiæ, and presently took station at Orôpus.<a id="FNanchor_94"
href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Though relieved, when they found that he passed by Peiræus
without making any attack, the Athenians knew that his destination
must now be against Eubœa; which to them was hardly less important
than Peiræus, since their main supplies were derived from that
island. Accordingly, they put to sea at once with all the triremes
which could be manned and got ready in the harbor. But from the
hurry of the occasion, coupled with the mistrust and dissension
now reigning, and the absence of their great naval force at Samos,
the crews mustered were raw and ill-selected, and the armament
inefficient. Polystratus, one of the members of the Four Hundred,
perhaps others of them also, were aboard; men who had an interest in
defeat rather than victory.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Thymocha<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span>rês, the admiral, conducted them round
Cape Sunium to Eretria in Eubœa, where he found a few other triremes,
which made up his whole fleet to thirty-six sail.</p>

<p>He had scarcely reached the harbor and disembarked, when, without
allowing time for his men to procure refreshment, he found himself
compelled to fight a battle with the forty-two ships of Agesandridas,
who had just sailed across from Orôpus, and was already approaching
the harbor. This surprise had been brought about by the anti-Athenian
party in Eretria, who took care, on the arrival of Thymocharês,
that no provisions should be found in the market-place, so that his
men were compelled to disperse and obtain them from houses at the
extremity of the town; while at the same time a signal was hoisted,
visible at Orôpus on the opposite side of the strait, less than
seven miles broad, indicating to Agesandridas the precise moment for
bringing his fleet across to the attack, with their crews fresh after
the morning meal. Thymocharês, on seeing the approach of the enemy,
ordered his men aboard; but, to his disappointment, many of them were
found to be so far off that they could not be brought back in time,
so that he was compelled to sail out and meet the Peloponnesians
with ships very inadequately manned. In a battle immediately outside
of the Eretrian harbor, he was, after a short contest, completely
defeated, and his fleet driven back upon the shore. Some of his
ships escaped to Chalkis, others to a fortified post garrisoned by
the Athenians themselves, not far from Eretria; yet not less than
twenty-two triremes, out of the whole thirty-six, fell into the hands
of Agesandridas, and a large proportion of the crews were slain or
made prisoners. Of those seamen who escaped, too, many found their
death from the hands of the Eretrians, into whose city they fled
for shelter. On the news of this battle, not merely Eretria, but
also all Eubœa,—except Oreus in the north of the island, which was
settled by Athenian kleruchs,—declared its revolt from Athens, which
had been intended more than a year before, and took measures for
defending itself in concert with Agesandridas and the Bœotians.<a
id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span></p> <p>Ill
could Athens endure a disaster, in itself so immense and aggravated,
under the present distressed condition of the city. Her last fleet
was destroyed, her nearest and most precious island torn from
her side; an island, which of late had yielded more to her wants
than Attica itself, but which was now about to become a hostile
and aggressive neighbor.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The previous revolt of Eubœa, occurring
thirty-four years before, during the maximum of Athenian power, had
been even then a terrible blow to Athens, and formed one of the main
circumstances which forced upon her the humiliation of the Thirty
years’ truce. But this second revolt took place when she had not only
no means of reconquering the island, but no means even of defending
Peiræus against the blockade by the enemy’s fleet. The dismay and
terror excited by the news at Athens was unbounded, even exceeding
what had been felt after the Sicilian catastrophe, or the revolt
of Chios. Nor was there any second reserve now in the treasury,
such as the thousand talents which had rendered such essential
service on the last-mentioned occasion. In addition to their foreign
dangers, the Athenians were farther weighed down by two intestine
calamities in themselves hardly supportable,—alienation of their
own fleet at Samos, and the discord, yet unappeased, within their
own walls; wherein the Four Hundred still held provisionally the
reins of government, with the ablest and most unscrupulous leaders
at their head. In the depth of their despair, the Athenians expected
nothing less than to see the victorious fleet of Agesandridas—more
than sixty triremes strong, including the recent captures—off
the Peiræus, forbidding all importation, and threatening them
with approaching famine, in combination with Agis and Dekeleia.
The enterprise would have been easy for there were neither ships
nor seamen to repel him; and his arrival at this critical moment
would most probably have enabled the Four Hundred to resume their
ascendency, with the means as well as the disposition to introduce
a Lacedæmonian garrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p.
74]</span> into the city.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And though the arrival of the Athenian
fleet from Samos would have prevented this extremity, yet it could
not have arrived in time, except on the supposition of a prolonged
blockade: moreover, its mere transfer from Samos to Athens would have
left Ionia and the Hellespont defenceless against the Lacedæmonians
and Persians, and would have caused the loss of all the Athenian
empire. Nothing could have saved Athens, if the Lacedæmonians at
this juncture had acted with reasonable vigor, instead of confining
their efforts to Eubœa, now an easy and certain conquest. As on the
former occasion, when Antiphon and Phrynichus went to Sparta prepared
to make any sacrifice for the purpose of obtaining Lacedæmonian aid
and accommodation, so now, in a still greater degree, Athens owed
her salvation only to the fact that the enemies actually before her
were indolent and dull Spartans, not enterprising Syracusans under
the conduct of Gylippus.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a> And this is the second occasion, we may
add, on which Athens was on the brink of ruin in consequence of the
policy of Alkibiadês in retaining the armament at Samos.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Athenians, no Agesandridas appeared off
Peiræus; so that the twenty triremes, which they contrived to man as
a remnant for defence, had no enemy to repel.<a id="FNanchor_100"
href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Accordingly, the
Athenians were allowed to enjoy an interval of repose which enabled
them to recover partially both from consternation and from intestine
discord. It was their first proceeding, when the hostile fleet did
not appear, to convene a public assembly; and that too in the Pnyx
itself, the habitual scene of the democratical assemblies, well
calculated to reinspire that patriotism which had now been dumb and
smouldering for the four last months. In this assembly, the tide of
opinion ran vehemently against the Four Hundred:<a id="FNanchor_101"
href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> even those, who,
like the Board of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span>
elders entitled probûli had originally counselled their appointment,
now denounced them along with the rest, though severely taunted by
the oligarchical leader Peisander for their inconsistency. Votes were
finally passed: 1. To depose the Four Hundred; 2. To place the whole
government in the hands of <i>The Five Thousand</i>; 3. Every citizen,
who furnished a panoply, either for himself or for any one else, was
to be of right a member of this body of <i>The</i> Five Thousand; 4. No
citizen was to receive pay for any political function, on pain of
becoming solemnly accursed, or excommunicated.<a id="FNanchor_102"
href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Such were the points
determined by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
first assembly held in the Pnyx. The archons, the senate of Five
Hundred, etc., were renewed: after which many other assem<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span>blies were also held,
in which nomothetæ, dikasts, and other institutions essential to
the working of the democracy, were constituted. Various other votes
were also passed; especially one, on the proposition of Kritias,
seconded by Theramenês,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> to restore Alkibiadês and some of his
friends from exile; while messages were farther despatched, both to
him and to the armament at Samos, doubtless confirming the recent
nomination of generals, apprizing them of what had recently occurred
at Athens, as well as bespeaking their full concurrence and unabated
efforts against the common enemy.</p>

<p>Thucydidês bestows marked eulogy upon the general spirit of
moderation and patriotic harmony which now reigned at Athens,
and which directed the political proceedings of the people.<a
id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
But he does not countenance the belief, as he has been sometimes
understood, nor is it true in point of fact, that they now introduced
a new constitution. Putting an end to the oligarchy, and to the
rule of the Four Hundred, they restored the old democracy<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span> seemingly with only
two modifications, first, the partial limitation of the right of
suffrage; next, the discontinuance of all payment for political
functions. The impeachment against Antiphon, tried immediately
afterwards, went before the senate and the dikastery exactly
according to the old democratical forms of procedure. But we must
presume that the senate, the dikasts, the nomothetæ, the ekklesiasts,
or citizens who attended the assembly, the public orators who
prosecuted state-criminals, or defended any law when it was impugned,
must have worked for the time without pay.</p>

<p>Moreover, the two modifications above mentioned were of little
practical effect. The exclusive body of Five Thousand citizens,
professedly constituted at this juncture, was neither exactly
realized, nor long retained. It was constituted, even now, more
as a nominal than as a real limit; a nominal total, yet no longer
a mere blank, as the Four Hundred had originally produced it, but
containing, indeed, a number of individual names greater than the
total, and without any assignable line of demarkation. The mere fact,
that every one who furnished a panoply was entitled to be of the Five
Thousand,—and not they alone, but others besides,<a id="FNanchor_105"
href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>—shows that no care
was taken to adhere either to that or to any other precise number.
If we may credit a speech composed by Lysias,<a id="FNanchor_106"
href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> the Four Hundred
had themselves, after the demolition of their intended fortress at
Ectioneia, and when power was passing out of their hands, appointed
a committee of their number to draw up for the first time a real
list of <i>The</i> Five Thousand; and Polystratus, a member of that
committee, takes credit with the succeeding democracy for having
made the list comprise nine thousand names instead of five thousand.
As this list of Polystratus—if, indeed, it ever existed—was never
either published or adopted, I merely notice the description given
of it, to illustrate my position that the number Five Thousand was
now understood on all sides as an indefinite expression for a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> suffrage extensive, but
not universal. The number had been first invented by Antiphon and
the leaders of the Four Hundred, to cloak their own usurpation and
intimidate the democracy: next, it served the purpose of Theramenês
and the minority of the Four Hundred, as a basis on which to raise
a sort of dynastic opposition, to use modern phraseology, within
the limits of the oligarchy; that is, without appearing to overstep
principles acknowledged by the oligarchy themselves: lastly, it was
employed by the democratical party generally as a convenient middle
term to slide back into the old system, with as little dispute
as possible; for Alkibiadês and the armament had sent word home
that they adhered to the Five Thousand, and to the abolition of
salaried civil functions.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>But exclusive suffrage of the so-called Five Thousand, especially
with the expansive numerical construction now adopted, was of little
value either to themselves or to the state;<a id="FNanchor_108"
href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> while it was an
insulting shock to the feelings of the excluded multitude, especially
to brave and active seamen like the parali. Though prudent as a step
of momentary transition, it could not stand, nor was any attempt
made to preserve it in permanence, amidst a community so long
accustomed to universal citizenship, and where the necessities of
defence against the enemy called for energetic efforts from all the
citizens.</p>

<p>Even as to the gratuitous functions, the members of the Five
Thousand themselves would soon become tired, not less than the
poorer freemen, of serving without pay, as senators or in other
ways; so that nothing but absolute financial deficit would
prevent the reëstablishment, entire or partial, of the pay.<a
id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
And that deficit was never so complete as to stop the disbursement
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span> the diobely,
or distribution of two oboli to each citizen on occasion of
various religious festivals. Such distribution continued without
interruption; though perhaps the number of occasions on which it was
made may have been lessened.</p>

<p>How far or under what restriction, any reëstablishment of civil
pay obtained footing during the seven years between the Four Hundred
and the Thirty, we cannot say. But leaving this point undecided,
we can show, that within a year after the deposition of the Four
Hundred, the suffrage of the so-called Five Thousand expanded into
the suffrage of all Athenians without exception, or into the full
antecedent democracy. A memorable decree, passed about eleven months
after that event,—at the commencement of the archonship of Glaukippus
(June 410 <small>B.C.</small>), when the senate of
Five Hundred, the dikasts, and other civil functionaries, were
renewed for the coming year, pursuant to the ancient democratical
practice,—exhibits to us the full democracy not merely in action,
but in all the glow of feeling called forth by a recent restoration.
It seems to have been thought that this first renewal of archons
and other functionaries, under the revived democracy, ought to
be stamped by some emphatic proclamation of sentiment, analogous
to the solemn and heart-stirring oath taken in the preceding
year at Samos. Accordingly, Demophantus proposed and carried a
(psephism or) decree,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a> prescribing the form of an oath to be
taken by all Athenians to stand by the democratical constitution.</p>

<p>The terms of his psephism and oath are striking. “If any man
subvert the democracy at Athens, or hold any magistracy after the
democracy has been subverted, he shall be an enemy of the Athenians.
Let him be put to death with impunity, and let his property be
confiscated to the public, with the reservation of a tithe to Athênê.
Let the man who has killed him, and the accomplice privy to the
act, be accounted holy and of good religious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> odor. Let all Athenians swear an oath
under the sacrifice of full-grown victims, in their respective tribes
and demes, to kill him.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Let the oath be as follows: ‘I will
kill with my own hand, if I am able, any man who shall subvert the
democracy at Athens, or who shall hold any office in future after the
democracy has been subverted, or shall rise in arms for the purpose
of making himself a despot, or shall help the despot to establish
himself. And if any one else shall kill him, I will account the
slayer to be holy as respects both gods and demons, as having slain
an enemy of the Athenians. And I engage by word, by deed, and by
vote, to sell his property and make over one-half of the proceeds
to the slayer, without withholding anything. If any man shall
perish in slaying or in trying to slay the despot, I will be kind
both to him and to his children, as to Harmodius and Aristogeiton,
and their descendants. And I hereby break and renounce all oaths
which have been sworn hostile to the Athenian people, either at
Athens or at the camp (at Samos) or elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_112"
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>’ Let all Athenians
swear this as the regular oath, immediately before the festival
of the Dionysia, with sacrifice and full-grown victims;<a
id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
invoking upon him who keeps it, good<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> things in abundance; but upon him who
breaks it, destruction for himself as well as for his family.”</p>

<p>Such was the remarkable decree which the Athenians not only
passed in senate and public assembly, less than a year after the
deposition of the Four Hundred, but also caused to be engraved on a
column close to the door of the senate-house. It plainly indicates,
not merely that the democracy had returned, but an unusual intensity
of democratical feeling along with it. The constitution which
<i>all</i> the Athenians thus swore to maintain by the most strenuous
measures of defence, must have been a constitution in which <i>all</i>
Athenians had political rights, not one of Five Thousand privileged
persons excluding the rest.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a> This decree became invalid after the
expulsion of the Thirty, by the general resolution then passed not to
act upon any laws passed before the archonship of Eukleidês, unless
specially reënacted. But the column on which it stood engraved still
remained, and the words were read upon it, at least down to the time
of the orator Lykurgus, eighty years afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_115"
href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The mere deposition of the Four Hundred, however, and the
transfer of political power to the Five Thousand, which took place
in the first public assembly held after the defeat off Eretria, was
sufficient to induce most of the violent leaders of the Four Hundred
forthwith to leave Athens. Peisander, Alexiklês, and others, went
off secretly to Dekeleia:<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Aristarchus alone<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> made his flight the means of inflicting a
new wound upon his country. Being among the number of the generals,
he availed himself of this authority to march—with some of the
rudest among those Scythian archers, who did the police duty of the
city—to Œnoê, on the Bœotian frontier, which was at that moment under
siege by a body of Corinthians and Bœotians united. Aristarchus, in
concert with the besiegers, presented himself to the garrison, and
acquainted them that Athens and Sparta had just concluded peace,
one of the conditions of which was that Œnoê should be surrendered
to the Bœotians. He therefore, as general, ordered them to evacuate
the place, under the benefit of a truce to return home. The garrison
having been closely blocked up, and kept wholly ignorant of the
actual condition of politics, obeyed the order without reserve; so
that the Bœotians acquired possession of this very important frontier
position, a new thorn in the side of Athens, besides Dekeleia.<a
id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the Athenian democracy again restored, and the divorce
between the city and the armament at Samos terminated after an
interruption of about four months by the successful conspiracy of
the Four Hundred. It was only by a sort of miracle—or rather by the
incredible backwardness and stupidity of her foreign enemies—that
Athens escaped alive from this nefarious aggression of her own
ablest and wealthiest citizens. That the victorious democracy
should animadvert upon and punish the principal actors concerned in
it,—who had satiated their own selfish ambition at the cost of so
much suffering, anxiety, and peril to their country,—was nothing
more than rigorous justice. But the circumstances of the case were
peculiar: for the counter-revolution had been accomplished partly by
the aid of a minority among the Four Hundred themselves,—Theramenês,
Aristokratês, and others, together with the Board of Elders called
Probûli,—all of whom had been, at the outset, either principals
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span> accomplices in
that system of terrorism and assassination, whereby the democracy
had been overthrown and the oligarchical rulers established in the
senate-house. The earlier operations of the conspiracy, therefore,
though among its worst features, could not be exposed to inquiry
and trial without compromising these parties as fellow-criminals.
Theramenês evaded this difficulty, by selecting for animadversion
a recent act of the majority of the Four Hundred, which he and his
partisans had opposed, and on which therefore he had no interests
adverse either to justice or to the popular feeling. He stood
foremost to impeach the last embassy sent by the Four Hundred to
Sparta, sent with instructions to purchase peace and alliance at
almost any price, and connected with the construction of the fort
at Ectioneia for the reception of an enemy’s garrison. This act
of manifest treason, in which Antiphon, Phrynichus, and ten other
known envoys were concerned, was chosen as the special matter
for public trial and punishment, not less on public grounds than
with a view to his own favor in the renewed democracy. But the
fact that it was Theramenês who thus denounced his old friends
and fellow-conspirators, after having lent hand and heart to
their earlier and not less guilty deeds, was long remembered as
a treacherous betrayal, and employed in after days as an excuse
for atrocious injustice against himself.<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Of the twelve envoys who went on this mission, all except
Phrynichus, Antiphon, Archeptolemus, and Onomaklês, seem to
have already escaped to Dekeleia or elsewhere. Phrynichus, as
I have mentioned <a href="#Phry">a few pages</a> above, had
been assassinated several days before. Respecting his memory, a
condemnatory vote had already been just passed by the restored senate
of Five Hundred, decreeing that his property should be confiscated
and his house razed to the ground, and conferring the gift of
citizenship, together with a pecuniary recompense, on two foreigners
who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> claimed to
have assassinated him.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"
class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The other three, Antiphon, Archeptolemus,
and Onomaklês,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a> were presented in name to the senate by
the generals, of whom probably Theramenês was one, as having gone
on a mission to Sparta for purposes of mischief to Athens, partly
on board an enemy’s ship, partly through the Spartan garrison at
Dekeleia. Upon this presentation, doubtless a document of some length
and going into particulars, a senator named Andron moved: That the
generals, aided by any ten senators whom they may choose, do seize
the three persons accused, and hold them in custody for trial; that
the thesmothetæ do send to each of the three a formal summons, to
prepare themselves for trial on a future day before the dikastery,
on the charge of high treason, and do bring them to trial on the
day named; assisted by the generals, the ten senators chosen as
auxiliaries, and any other citizen who may please to take part, as
their accusers. Each of the three was to be tried separately, and,
if condemned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> was
to be dealt with according to the penal law of the city against
traitors, or persons guilty of treason.<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Though all the three persons thus indicated were at Athens, or
at least were supposed to be there, on the day when this resolution
was passed by the senate, yet, before it was executed, Onomaklês had
fled; so that Antiphon and Archeptolemus only were imprisoned for
trial. They too must have had ample opportunity for leaving the city,
and we might have presumed that Antiphon would have thought it quite
as necessary to retire as Peisander and Alexiklês. So acute a man as
he, at no time very popular, must have known that now at least he had
drawn the sword against his fellow-citizens in a manner which could
never be forgiven. However, he chose voluntarily to stay: and this
man, who had given orders for taking off so many of the democratical
speakers by private assassination, received from the democracy, when
triumphant, full notice and fair trial on a distinct and specific
charge. The speech which he made in his defence, though it did not
procure acquittal, was listened to, not merely with patience, but
with admiration; as we may judge from the powerful and lasting effect
which it produced. Thucydidês describes it as the most magnificent
defence against a capital charge which had ever come before him;<a
id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and
the poet Agathon, doubtless a hearer, warmly complimented Antiphon
on his eloquence; to which the latter replied, that the approval of
one such discerning judge was in his eyes an ample compensation for
the unfriendly verdict of the multitude. Both he and Archeptolemus
were found guilty by the dikastery and condemned to the penalties
of treason. They were handed over to the magistrates called the
Eleven, the chiefs of executive justice at Athens, to be put to death
by the customary draught of hemlock. Their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span> properties were confiscated, their
houses were directed to be razed, and the vacant site to be marked
by columns, with the inscription: “The residence of Antiphon the
traitor,—of Archeptolemus the traitor.” They were not permitted
to be buried either in Attica, or in any territory subject to
Athenian dominion.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Their children, both legitimate and
illegitimate, were deprived of the citizenship; and the citizen who
should adopt any descendant of either of them, was to be himself in
like manner disfranchised.</p>

<p>Such was the sentence passed by the dikastery, pursuant to
the Athenian law of treason. It was directed to be engraved on
the same brazen column as the decree of honor to the slayers of
Phrynichus. From that column it was transcribed, and has thus
passed into history.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"
class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span></p> <p>How many of the Four Hundred
oligarchs actually came to trial or were punished, we have no
means of knowing; but there is ground for believing that none
were put to death except Antiphon and Archeptolemus, perhaps also
Aristarchus, the betrayer of Œnoê to the Bœotians. The latter is
said to have been formally tried and condemned:<a id="FNanchor_125"
href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> though by what
accident he afterwards came into the power of the Athenians, after
having once effected his escape, we are not informed. The property of
Peisander, he himself having escaped, was confiscated, and granted
either wholly or in part as a recompense to Apollodorus, one of the
assassins of Phrynichus:<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> probably the property of the other
conspicuous fugitive oligarchs was confiscated also. Polystratus,
another of the Four Hundred, who had only become a member of that
body a few days before its fall, was tried during absence, which
absence his defenders afterwards accounted for, by saying that he
had been wounded in the naval battle of Eretria, and heavily fined.
It seems that each of the Four Hundred was called on to go through
an audit and a trial of accountability, according to the practice
general at Athens with magistrates going out of office. Such of them
as did not appear to this trial were condemned to fine, to exile, or
to have their names recorded as traitors: but most of those who did
appear seem to have been acquitted; partly, we are told, by bribes to
the logistæ, or auditing officers, though some were condemned either
to fine or to partial political disability, along with those hoplites
who had been the most marked partisans of the Four Hundred.<a
id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span></p>

<p>Indistinctly as we make out the particular proceedings of the
Athenian people at this restoration of the democracy, we know<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> from Thucydidês that
their prudence and moderation were exemplary. The eulogy, which he
bestows in such emphatic terms upon their behavior at this juncture,
is indeed doubly remarkable:<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128"
class="fnanchor">[128]</a> first, because it comes from an exile,
not friendly to the democracy, and a strong admirer of Antiphon;
next, because the juncture itself was one eminently trying to the
popular morality, and likely to degenerate, by almost natural
tendency, into excess of reactionary vengeance and persecution. The
democracy was now one hundred years old, dating from Kleisthenês,
and fifty years old, even dating from the final reforms of Ephialtês
and Periklês; so that self-government and political equality were a
part of the habitual sentiment of every man’s bosom, heightened in
this case by the fact that Athens was not merely a democracy, but an
imperial democracy, having dependencies abroad.<a id="FNanchor_129"
href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> At a moment when,
from unparalleled previous disasters, she is barely able to keep
up the struggle against her foreign enemies, a small knot of
her own wealthiest citizens, taking advantage of her weakness,
contrive, by a tissue of fraud and force not less flagitious than
skilfully combined, to concentrate in their own hands the powers
of the state, and to tear from their countrymen the security
against bad government, the sentiment of equal citizenship, and
the long-established freedom of speech. Nor is this all: these
conspirators not only plant an oligarchical sovereignty in the
senate-house, but also sustain that sovereignty by inviting a
foreign garrison from without, and by betraying Athens to her
Peloponnesian enemies. Two more deadly injuries it is impossi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>ble to imagine; and from
neither of them would Athens have escaped, if her foreign enemy had
manifested reasonable alacrity. Considering the immense peril, the
narrow escape, and the impaired condition in which Athens was left,
notwithstanding her escape, we might well have expected in the people
a violence of reactionary hostility such as every calm observer,
while making allowance for the provocation, must nevertheless have
condemned; and perhaps somewhat analogous to that exasperation
which, under very similar circumstances, had caused the bloody
massacres at Korkyra.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> And when we find that this is exactly the
occasion which Thucydidês, an observer rather less than impartial,
selects to eulogize their good conduct and moderation, we are made
deeply sensible of the good habits which their previous democracy
must have implanted in them, and which now served as a corrective
to the impulse of the actual moment. They had become familiar with
the cementing force of a common sentiment; they had learned to hold
sacred the inviolability of law and justice, even in respect to
their worst enemy; and what was of not less moment, the frequency
and freedom of political discussion had taught them not only to
substitute the contentions of the tongue for those of the sword, but
also to conceive their situation with its present and prospective
liabilities, instead of being hurried away by blind retrospective
vengeance against the past.</p>

<p>There are few contrasts in Grecian history more memorable or
more instructive, than that between this oligarchical conspiracy,
conducted by some of the ablest hands at Athens, and the democratical
movement going on at the same time in Samos, among the Athenian
armament and the Samian citizens. In the former, we have nothing
but selfishness and personal ambition, from the beginning: first,
a partnership to seize for their own advantage the powers of
government; next, after this object has been accomplished, a breach
among the partners, arising out of disappointment alike selfish. We
find appeal made to nothing but the worst tendencies; either tricks
to practise upon the credulity of the people, or extra-judicial
murders to work upon their fear. In the latter, on the contrary,
the sentiment invoked is that of common patriotism, and equal,
public-minded sympathy. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p.
92]</span> which we read in Thucydidês,—when the soldiers of the
armament and the Samian citizens, pledged themselves to each other by
solemn oaths to uphold their democracy, to maintain harmony and good
feeling with each other, to prosecute energetically the war against
the Peloponnesians, and to remain at enmity with the oligarchical
conspirators at Athens,—is a scene among the most dramatic and
inspiriting which occurs in his history.<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Moreover, we
recognize at Samos the same absence of reactionary vengeance as
at Athens, after the attack of the oligarchs, Athenian as well as
Samian, has been repelled; although those oligarchs had begun by
assassinating Hyperbolus and others. There is throughout this whole
democratical movement at Samos a generous exaltation of common
sentiment over personal, and at the same time an absence of ferocity
against opponents, such as nothing except democracy ever inspired in
the Grecian bosom.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, true that this was a special movement of
generous enthusiasm, and that the details of a democratical
government correspond to it but imperfectly. Neither in the life
of an individual, nor in that of a people, does the ordinary and
every-day movement appear at all worthy of those particular seasons
in which a man is lifted above his own level and becomes capable
of extreme devotion and heroism. Yet such emotions, though their
complete predominance is never otherwise than transitory, have their
foundation in veins of sentiment which are not even at other times
wholly extinct, but count among the manifold forces tending to
modify and improve, if they cannot govern, human action. Even their
moments of transitory predominance leave a luminous track behind,
and render the men who have passed through them more apt to conceive
again the same generous impulse, though in fainter degree. It is
one of the merits of Grecian democracy that it <i>did</i> raise this
feeling of equal and patriotic communion: sometimes, and on rare
occasions, like the scene at Samos, with overwhelming intensity, so
as to impassion an unanimous multitude; more frequently, in feebler
tide, yet such as gave some chance to an honest and eloquent orator,
of making successful appeal to public feeling against corruption or
selfishness. If we follow the movements of Antiphon and his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> fellow-conspirators
at Athens, contemporaneous with the democratical manifestations
at Samos, we shall see that not only was no such generous impulse
included in it, but the success of their scheme depended upon their
being able to strike all common and active patriotism out of the
Athenian bosom. Under the “cold shade” of their oligarchy—even if we
suppose the absence of cruelty and rapacity, which would probably
soon have become rife had their dominion lasted, as we shall
presently learn from the history of the second oligarchy of Thirty—no
sentiment would have been left to the Athenian multitude except fear,
servility, or at best a tame and dumb sequacity to leaders whom they
neither chose nor controlled. To those who regard different forms of
government as distinguished from each other mainly by the feelings
which each tends to inspire in magistrates as well as citizens, the
contemporaneous scenes of Athens and Samos will suggest instructive
comparisons between Grecian oligarchy and Grecian democracy.</p>

  THE RESTORED ATHENIAN DEMOCRACY, AFTER THE DEPOSITION
  OF THE FOUR HUNDRED, DOWN TO THE ARRIVAL OF CYRUS
  THE YOUNGER IN ASIA MINOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> oligarchy of Four
Hundred at Athens, installed in the senate-house about February or
March 411 <small>B.C.</small>, and deposed about July of the same
year, after four or five months of danger and distraction such as
to bring her almost within the grasp of her enemies, has now been
terminated by the restoration of her democracy; with what attendant
circumstances, has been amply detailed. I now revert to the military
and naval operations on the Asiatic coast, partly contemporaneous
with the political dissensions at Athens, above described.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the Peloponnesian fleet of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span> ninety-four triremes,<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
having remained not less than eighty days idle at Rhodes, had come
back to Milêtus towards the end of March; with the intention of
proceeding to the rescue of Chios, which a portion of the Athenian
armament under Strombichidês had been for some time besieging, and
which was now in the greatest distress. The main Athenian fleet at
Samos, however, prevented Astyochus from effecting this object,
since he did not think it advisable to hazard a general battle. He
was influenced partly by the bribes, partly by the delusions, of
Tissaphernês, who sought only to wear out both parties by protracted
war, and who now professed to be on the point of bringing up the
Phenician fleet to his aid. Astyochus had in his fleet the ships
which had been brought over for coöperation with Pharnabazus at
the Hellespont, and which were thus equally unable to reach their
destination. To meet this difficulty, the Spartan Derkyllidas was
sent with a body of troops by land to the Hellespont, there to
join Pharnabazus, in acting against Abydos and the neighboring
dependencies of Athens. Abydos, connected with Milêtus by colonial
ties, set the example of revolting from Athens to Derkyllidas and
Pharnabazus; an example followed, two days afterwards, by the
neighboring town of Lampsakus.</p>

<p>It does not appear that there was at this time any Athenian
force in the Hellespont; and the news of this danger to the empire
in a fresh quarter, when conveyed to Chios, alarmed Strombichidês,
the commander of the Athenian besieging armament. Though the
Chians—driven to despair by increasing famine as well as by want of
relief from Astyochus, and having recently increased their fleet
to thirty-six triremes against the Athenian thirty-two, by the
arrival of twelve ships under Leon, obtained from Milêtus during
the absence of Astyochus at Rhodes—had sallied out and fought an
obstinate naval battle against the Athenians, with some advantage,<a
id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> yet
Strombichidês felt compelled immediately to carry away twenty-four
triremes and a body of hoplites for the relief of the Hellespont.
Hence the Chians became sufficiently masters of the sea to provision
themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span> afresh,
though the Athenian armament and fortified post still remained on
the island. Astyochus also was enabled to recall Leon with the
twelve triremes to Milêtus, and thus to strengthen his main fleet.<a
id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>The present appears to have been the time, when the oligarchical
party both in the town and in the camp at Samos, were laying their
plan of conspiracy as already recounted, and when the Athenian
generals were divided in opinion, Charmînus siding with this party,
Leon and Diomedon against it. Apprized of the reigning dissension,
Astyochus thought it a favorable opportunity for sailing with
his whole fleet up to the harbor of Samos, and offering battle;
but the Athenians were in no condition to leave the harbor. He
accordingly returned to Milêtus, where he again remained inactive,
in expectation, real or pretended, of the arrival of the Phenician
ships. But the discontent of his own troops, especially the Syracusan
contingent, presently became uncontrollable. They not only murmured
at the inaction of the armament during this precious moment of
disunion in the Athenian camp, but also detected the insidious policy
of Tissaphernês in thus frittering away their strength without
result; a policy still more keenly brought home to their feelings
by his irregularity in supplying them with pay and provision, which
caused serious distress. To appease their clamors, Astyochus was
compelled to call together a general assembly, the resolution of
which was pronounced in favor of immediate battle. He accordingly
sailed from Milêtus with his whole fleet of one hundred and twelve
triremes round to the promontory of Mykalê immediately opposite
Samos, ordering the Milesian hoplites to cross the promontory by
land to the same point. The Athenian fleet, now consisting of
only eighty-two sail, in the absence of Strombichidês, was then
moored near Glaukê on the mainland of Mykalê; but the public
decision just taken by the Peloponnesians to fight becoming known
to them, they retired to Samos, not being willing to engage with
such inferior numbers.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>It seems to have been during this last interval of inaction on
the part of Astyochus, that the oligarchical party in Samos made
their attempt and miscarried; the reaction from which at<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>tempt brought about,
with little delay, the great democratical manifestation, and
solemn collective oath, of the Athenian armament, coupled with the
nomination of new, cordial, and unanimous generals. They were now in
high enthusiasm, anxious for battle with the enemy, and Strombichidês
had been sent for immediately, that the fleet might be united against
the main enemy at Milêtus. That officer had recovered Lampsakus,
but had failed in his attempt on Abydos.<a id="FNanchor_136"
href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Having established
a central fortified station at Sestos, he now rejoined the fleet
at Samos, which by his arrival was increased to one hundred and
eight sail. He arrived in the night, when the Peloponnesian fleet
was preparing to renew its attack from Mykalê the next morning. It
consisted of one hundred and twelve ships, and was therefore still
superior in number to the Athenians. But having now learned both
the arrival of Strombichidês, and the renewed spirit as well as
unanimity of the Athenians, the Peloponnesian commanders did not
venture to persist in their resolution of fighting. They returned
back to Milêtus, to the mouth of which harbor the Athenians sailed,
and had the satisfaction of offering battle to an unwilling enemy.<a
id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Such confession of inferiority was well calculated to embitter
still farther the discontents of the Peloponnesian fleet at Milêtus.
Tissaphernês had become more and more parsimonious in furnishing pay
and supplies; while the recall of Alkibiadês to Samos, which happened
just now, combined with the uninterrupted apparent intimacy between
him and the satrap, confirmed their belief that the latter was
intentionally cheating and starving them in the interest of Athens.
At the same time, earnest invitations arrived from Pharnabazus,
soliciting the coöperation of the fleet at the Hellespont, with
liberal promises of pay and maintenance. Klearchus, who had been
sent out with the last squadron from Sparta, for the express purpose
of going to aid Pharnabazus, claimed to be allowed to execute his
orders; while Astyochus also, having renounced the idea of any united
action, thought it now expedient to divide the fleet, which he was
at a loss how to support. Accordingly, Klearchus was sent with forty
triremes from Milêtus to the Hellespont, yet with instructions to
evade the Athenians at Samos, by first stretching out westward
into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> Ægean.
Encountering severe storms, he was forced with the greater part of
his squadron to seek shelter at Delos, and even suffered so much
damage as to return to Milêtus, from whence he himself marched to
the Hellespont by land. Ten of his triremes, however, under the
Megarian Helixus, weathered the storm and pursued their voyage to the
Hellespont, which was at this moment unguarded, since Strombichidês
seems to have brought back all his squadron. Helixus passed on
unopposed to Byzantium, a Doric city and Megarian colony, from whence
secret invitations had already reached him, and which he now induced
to revolt from Athens. This untoward news admonished the Athenian
generals at Samos, whose vigilance the circuitous route of Klearchus
had eluded, of the necessity of guarding the Hellespont, whither they
sent a detachment, and even attempted in vain to recapture Byzantium.
Sixteen fresh triremes afterwards proceeded from Milêtus to the
Hellespont and Abydos, thus enabling the Peloponnesians to watch that
strait as well as the Bosphorus and Byzantium,<a id="FNanchor_138"
href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and even to ravage
the Thracian Chersonese.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the discontents of the fleet at Milêtus broke out into
open mutiny against Astyochus and Tissaphernês. Unpaid, and only
half-fed, the seamen came together in crowds to talk over their
grievances; denouncing Astyochus as having betrayed them for his own
profit to the satrap, who was treacherously ruining the armament
under the inspirations of Alkibiadês. Even some of the officers,
whose silence had been hitherto purchased, began to hold the same
language; perceiving that the mischief was becoming irreparable,
and that the men were actually on the point of desertion. Above
all, the incorruptible Hermokratês of Syracuse, and Dorieus the
Thurian commander, zealously espoused the claims of their seamen,
who being mostly freemen (in greater proportion than the crews of
the Peloponnesian ships), went in a body to Astyochus, with loud
complaints and demand of their arrears of pay. But the Peloponnesian
general received them with haughtiness and even with menace, lifting
up his stick to strike the commander Dorieus while advocating their
cause. Such was the resentment of the seamen that they rushed forward
to pelt Astyochus with missiles: he took<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> refuge, however, on a neighboring
altar, so that no actual mischief was done.<a id="FNanchor_139"
href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the discontent confined to the seamen of the fleet.
The Milesians, also, displeased and alarmed at the fort which
Tissaphernês had built in their town, watched an opportunity of
attacking it by surprise, and expelled his garrison. Though the
armament in general, now full of antipathy against the satrap,
sympathized in this proceeding, yet the Spartan commissioner Lichas
censured it severely, and intimated to the Milesians that they, as
well as the other Greeks in the king’s territory, were bound to
be subservient to Tissaphernês within all reasonable limits, and
even to court him by extreme subservience, until the war should be
prosperously terminated. It appears that in other matters also,
Lichas had enforced instead of mitigating the authority of the satrap
over them; so that the Milesians now came to hate him vehemently,<a
id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
and when he shortly afterwards died of sickness, they refused
permission to bury him in the spot—probably some place of honor—which
his surviving countrymen had fixed upon. Though Lichas in these
enforcements only carried out the stipulations of his treaty with
Persia, yet it is certain that the Milesians, instead of acquiring
autonomy, according to the general promises of Sparta, were now
farther from it than ever, and that imperial Athens had protected
them against Persia much better than Sparta.</p>

<p>The subordination of the armament, however, was now almost at
an end, when Mindarus arrived from Sparta as admiral to supersede
Astyochus, who was summoned home and took his departure. Both
Hermokratês and some Milesian deputies availed themselves of this
opportunity to go to Sparta for the purpose of preferring complaints
against Tissaphernês; while the latter on his part sent thither an
envoy named Gaulites, a Karian, brought up in equal familiarity
with the Greek and Karian languages, both to defend himself against
the often-repeated charges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p.
99]</span> of Hermokratês, that he had been treacherously withholding
the pay under concert with Alkibiadês and the Athenians, and to
denounce the Milesians on his own side, as having wrongfully
demolished his fort.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"
class="fnanchor">[141]</a> At the same time he thought it necessary
to put forward a new pretence, for the purpose of strengthening the
negotiations of his envoy at Sparta, soothing the impatience of the
armament, and conciliating the new admiral Mindarus. He announced
that the Phenician fleet was on the point of arriving at Aspendus
in Pamphylia, and that he was going thither to meet it, for the
purpose of bringing it up to the seat of war to coöperate with the
Peloponnesians. He invited Lichas to accompany him, and engaged to
leave Tamos at Milêtus, as deputy during his absence, with orders
to furnish pay and maintenance to the fleet.<a id="FNanchor_142"
href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Mindarus, a new commander, without any experience of the mendacity
of Tissaphernês, was imposed upon by this plausible assurance, and
even captivated by the near prospect of so powerful a reinforcement.
He despatched an officer named Philippus with two triremes round the
Triopian Cape to Aspendus, while the satrap went thither by land.</p>

<p>Here again was a fresh delay of no inconsiderable length, while
Tissaphernês was absent at Aspendus, on this ostensible purpose. Some
time elapsed before Mindarus was undeceived, for Philippus found
the Phenician fleet at Aspendus, and was therefore at first full of
hope that it was really coming onward. But the satrap soon showed
that his purpose now, as heretofore, was nothing better than delay
and delusion. The Phenician ships were one hundred and forty-seven
in number; a fleet more than sufficient for concluding the maritime
war, if brought up to act zealously. But Tissaphernês affected to
think that this was a small force, unworthy of the majesty of the
Great King; who had commanded a fleet of three hundred sail to be
fitted out for the service.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
class="fnanchor">[143]</a> He waited for some time in pretended
expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span> that
more ships were on their way, disregarding all the remonstrances of
the Lacedæmonian officers.</p>

<p>Presently arrived the Athenian Alkibiadês, with thirteen Athenian
triremes, exhibiting himself as on the best terms with the satrap.
He too had made use of this approaching Phenician fleet to delude
his countrymen at Samos, by promising to go and meet Tissaphernês at
Aspendus, and to determine him, if possible, to send the fleet to the
assistance of Athens, but at the very least, <i>not</i> to send it to the
aid of Sparta. The latter alternative of the promise was sufficiently
safe, for he knew well that Tissaphernês had no intention of applying
the fleet to any really efficient purpose. But he was thereby enabled
to take credit with his countrymen for having been the means of
diverting this formidable reinforcement from the enemy.</p>

<p>Partly the apparent confidence between Tissaphernês and
Alkibiadês, partly the impudent shifts of the former, grounded on
the incredible pretence that the fleet was insufficient in number,
at length satisfied Philippus that the present was only a new
manifestation of deceit. After a long and vexatious interval, he
apprized Mindarus—not without indignant abuse of the satrap—that
nothing was to be hoped from the fleet at Aspendus. Yet the
proceeding of Tissaphernês, indeed, in bringing up the Phenicians
to that place, and still withholding the order for farther advance
and action, was in every one’s eyes mysterious and unaccountable.
Some fancied that he did it with a view of levying larger bribes
from the Phenicians themselves, as a premium for being sent home
without fighting, as it appears that they actually were. But
Thucydidês supposes that he had no other motive than that which had
determined his behavior during the last year, to protract the war and
impoverish both Athens and Sparta, by setting up a fresh deception,
which would last for some weeks, and thus procure so much delay.<a
id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> The
historian is doubtless right: but without his assurance, it would
have been difficult to believe, that the maintenance of a fraudulent
pretence, for so inconsiderable a time, should have been held as an
adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> motive
for bringing this large fleet from Phenicia to Aspendus, and then
sending it away unemployed.</p>

<p>Having at length lost all hope of the Phenician ships, Mindarus
resolved to break off all dealing with the perfidious Tissaphernês;
the more so, as Tamos, the deputy of the latter, though left
ostensibly to pay and keep the fleet, performed that duty with
greater irregularity than ever, and to conduct his fleet to the
Hellespont into coöperation with Pharnabazus, who still continued his
promises and invitations. The Peloponnesian fleet<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>—seventy-three
triremes strong, after deducting thirteen which had been sent under
Dorieus to suppress some disturbances in Rhodes—having been carefully
prepared beforehand, was put in motion by sudden order, so that no
previous intimation might reach the Athenians at Samos. After having
been delayed some days at Ikarus by bad weather, Mindarus reached
Chios in safety. But here he was pursued by Thrasyllus, who passed,
with fifty-five triremes, to the northward of Chios, and was thus
between the Lacedæmonian admiral and the Hellespont. Believing that
Mindarus would remain some time at Chios, Thrasyllus placed scouts
both on the high lands of Lesbos and on the continent opposite Chios,
in order that he might receive instant notice of any movement on the
part of the enemy’s fleet.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Meanwhile he employed his Athenian force
in reducing the Lesbian town of Eresus, which had been lately
prevailed on to revolt by a body of three hundred assailants from
Kymê under the Theban Anaxander, partly Methymnæan exiles, with some
political sympathizers, partly mercenary foreigners, who succeeded in
carrying Eresus after failing in an attack on Methymna. Thrasyllus
found before Eresus a small Athenian squadron of five triremes under
Thrasybulus, who had been despatched from Samos to try and forestall
the revolt, but had arrived too late. He was farther joined<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span> by two triremes from
the Hellespont, and by others from Methymna, so that his entire fleet
reached the number of sixty-seven triremes, with which he proceeded
to lay siege to Eresus; trusting to his scouts for timely warning, in
case the enemy’s fleet should move northward.</p>

<p>The course which Thrasyllus expected the Peloponnesian fleet to
take, was to sail from Chios northward through the strait which
separates the northeastern portion of that island from Mount Mimas on
the Asiatic mainland: after which it would probably sail past Eresus
on the western side of Lesbos, as being the shortest track to the
Hellespont, though it might also go round on the eastern side between
Lesbos and the continent, by a somewhat longer route. The Athenian
scouts were planted so as to descry the Peloponnesian fleet, if it
either passed through this strait or neared the island of Lesbos.
But Mindarus did neither; thus eluding their watch, and reaching the
Hellespont without the knowledge of the Athenians. Having passed two
days in provisioning his ships, receiving besides from the Chians
three tesserakosts, a Chian coin of unknown value, for each man among
his seamen, he departed on the third day from Chios, but took a
southerly route and rounded the island in all haste on its western or
sea-side. Having reached and passed the northern latitude of Chios,
he took an eastward course, with Lesbos at some distance to his left
hand, direct to the mainland; which he touched at a harbor called
Karterii, in the Phokæan territory. Here he stopped to give the crew
their morning meal: he then crossed the arc of the gulf of Kymê to
the little islets called Arginusæ, close on the Asiatic continent
opposite Mitylênê, where he again halted for supper. Continuing his
voyage onward during most part of the night, he was at Harmatûs,
on the continent, directly northward and opposite to Methymna, by
the next day’s morning meal: then still hastening forward after
a short halt, he doubled Cape Lektum, sailed along the Troad and
passed Tenedos, and reached the entrance of the Hellespont before
midnight; where his ships were distributed at Sigeium, Rhœteium, and
other neighboring places.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span></p> <p>By this well-laid course
and accelerated voyage, the Peloponnesian fleet completely
eluded the lookers-out of Thrasyllus, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span> reached the opening of the Hellespont
when that admiral was barely apprized of its departure from
Chios. When it arrived at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[p.
105]</span> Harmatûs, however, opposite to and almost within sight of
the Athenian station at Methymna, its progress could no longer remain
a secret. As it advanced still farther along the Troad, the momentous
news circulated everywhere, and was promulgated through numerous
fire-signals and beacons on the hill, by friend as well as by foe.</p>

<p>These signals were perfectly visible, and perfectly intelligible,
to the two hostile squadrons now on guard on each side of the
Hellespont: eighteen Athenian triremes at Sestos in Europe, sixteen
Peloponnesian triremes at Abydos in Asia. To the former it was
destruction, to be caught by this powerful enemy in the narrow
channel of the Hellespont. They quitted Sestos in the middle of the
night, passing opposite to Abydos, and keeping a southerly course
close along the shore of the Chersonese, in the direction towards
Elæûs at the southern extremity of that peninsular, so as to have
the chance of escape in the open sea and of joining Thrasyllus. But
they would not have been allowed to pass even the hostile station at
Abydos, had not the Peloponnesian guardships received the strictest
orders from Mindarus, transmitted before he left Chios, or perhaps
even before he left Milêtus, that, if he should attempt the start,
they were to keep a vigilant and special look-out for his coming,
and reserve themselves to lend him such assistance as might be
needed, in case he were attacked by Thrasyllus. When the signals
first announced the arrival of Mindarus, the Peloponnesian guardships
at Abydos could not know in what position he was, nor whether the
main Athenian fleet might not be near upon him. Accordingly they
acted on these previous orders, holding themselves in reserve<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span> in their station
at Abydos, until daylight should arrive, and they should be
better informed. They thus neglected the Athenian Hellespontine
squadron in its escape from Sestos to Elæûs.<a id="FNanchor_148"
href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span></p> <p>On arriving
about daylight near the southern point of the Chersonese, these
Athenians were descried by the fleet of Min<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>darus, which had come the night before
to the opposite stations of Sigeium and Rhœteium. The latter
immediately gave chase:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p.
109]</span> but the Athenians, now in the wide sea, contrived to
escape most of them to Imbros, not without the loss, however, of four
triremes, one even captured with all the crew on board, near the
temple of Protesilaus at Elæûs: the crews of the other three escaped
ashore. Mindarus was now joined by the squadron from Abydos, and
their united force, eighty-six triremes strong, was employed for one
day in trying to storm Elæûs. Failing in this enterprise, the fleet
retired to Abydos. Before all could arrive there, Thrasyllus with his
fleet arrived in haste from Eresus, much disappointed that his scouts
had been eluded and all his calculations baffled. Two Peloponnesian
triremes, which had been more adventurous than the rest in pursuing
the Athenians, fell into his hands. He waited at Elæûs the return of
the fugitive Athenian squadron from Imbros, and then began to prepare
his triremes, seventy-six in number, for a general action.</p>

<p>After five days of such preparation, his fleet was brought to
battle, sailing northward towards Sestos up the Hellespont, by
single ships ahead, along the coast of the Chersonese, or on the
European side. The left or most advanced squadron, under Thrasyllus,
stretched even beyond the headland called Kynossêma, or the Dog’s
Tomb, ennobled by the legend and the chapel of the Trojan queen
Hecuba: it was thus nearly opposite Abydos, while the right squadron
under Thrasybulus was not very far from the southern mouth of the
strait, nearly opposite Dardanus. Mindarus on his side brought
into action eighty-six triremes, ten more than Thrasyllus in total
number, extending from Abydos to Dardanus on the Asiatic shore;
the Syracusans under Hermokratês being on the right, opposed to
Thrasyllus, while Mindarus with the Peloponnesian ships was on
the left opposed to Thrasybulus. The epibatæ or maritime hoplites
on board the ships of Mindarus are said to have been superior to
the Athenians, but the latter had the advantage in skilful pilots
and nau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>tical
manœuvring: nevertheless, the description of the battle tells us
how much Athenian manœuvring had fallen off since the glories of
Phormion at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war; nor would that
eminent seaman have selected for the scene of a naval battle the
narrow waters of the Hellespont. Mindarus took the aggressive,
advancing to attack near the European shore, and trying to outflank
his opponents on both sides, as well as to drive them up against
the land. Thrasyllus on one wing, and Thrasybulus on the other, by
rapid movements, extended themselves so as to frustrate this attempt
to outflank them; but in so doing, they stripped and weakened the
centre, which was even deprived of the sight of the left wing by
means of the projecting headland of Kynossêma. Thus unsupported,
the centre was vigorously attacked and roughly handled by the
middle division of Mindarus. Its ships were driven up against the
land, and the assailants even disembarked to push their victory
against the men ashore. But this partial success threw the central
Peloponnesian division itself into disorder, while Thrasybulus and
Thrasyllus carried on a conflict at first equal, and presently
victorious, against the ships on the right and left of the enemy.
Having driven back both these two divisions, they easily chased away
the disordered ships of the centre, so that the whole Peloponnesian
fleet was put to flight, and found shelter first in the river
Meidius, next in Abydos. The narrow breadth of the Hellespont
forbade either long pursuit or numerous captures. Nevertheless,
eight Chian ships, five Corinthians, two Ambrakian, and as many
Bœotian, and from Sparta, Syracuse, Pellênê, and Leukas, one each,
fell into the hands of the Athenian admirals; who, however, on their
own side lost fifteen ships. They erected a trophy on the headland
of Kynossêma, near the tomb or chapel of Hecuba; not omitting the
usual duties of burying their own dead, and giving up those of the
enemy under the customary request for truce.<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span></p> <p>A victory so
incomplete and indecisive would have been little valued by the
Athenians, in the times preceding the Sicilian expedition. But since
that overwhelming disaster, followed by so many other misfortunes,
and last of all, by the defeat of Thymocharis, with the revolt of
Eubœa, their spirit had been so sadly lowered, that the trireme
which brought the news of the battle of Kynossêma, seemingly towards
the end of August 411 <small>B.C.</small>, was welcomed
with the utmost delight and triumph. They began to feel as if the
ebb-tide had reached its lowest point, and had begun to turn in their
favor, holding out some hopes of ultimate success in the war. Another
piece of good fortune soon happened, to strengthen this belief.
Mindarus was compelled to reinforce himself at the Hellespont by
sending Hippokratês and Epiklês to bring the fleet of fifty triremes
now acting at Eubœa.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
class="fnanchor">[150]</a> This was in itself an important relief to
Athens, by withdrawing an annoying enemy near home. But it was still
further enhanced by the subsequent misfortunes of this fleet, which,
in passing round the headland of Mount Athos to get to Asia, was
overtaken by a terrific storm and nearly destroyed, with great loss
of life among the crews; so that a remnant only, under Hippokratês,
survived to join Mindarus.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>But though Athens was thus exempted from all fear of aggression
on the side of Eubœa, the consequences of this departure of the
fleet were such as to demonstrate how irreparably the island
itself had passed out of her supremacy. The inhabitants<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> of Chalkis and
the other cities, now left without foreign defence against her,
employed themselves jointly with the Bœotians, whose interest in
the case was even stronger than their own, in divesting Eubœa of
its insular character, by constructing a mole or bridge across the
Euripus, the narrowest portion of the Eubœan strait, where Chalkis
was divided from Bœotia. From each coast a mole was thrown out,
each mole guarded at the extremity by a tower, and leaving only
an intermediate opening, broad enough for a single vessel to pass
through, covered by a wooden bridge. It was in vain that the Athenian
Theramenês, with thirty triremes, presented himself to obstruct
the progress of this undertaking. The Eubœans and Bœotians both
prosecuted it in such numbers, and with so much zeal, that it was
speedily brought to completion. Eubœa, so lately the most important
island attached to Athens, is from henceforward a portion of the
mainland, altogether independent of her, even though it should please
fortune to reëstablish her maritime power.<a id="FNanchor_152"
href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>The battle of Kynossêma produced no very important consequences
except that of encouragement to the Athenians. Even just after the
action, Kyzikus revolted from them, and on the fourth day after
it, the Athenian fleet, hastily refitted at Sestos, sailed to that
place to retake it. It was unfortified, so that they succeeded
with little difficulty, and imposed upon it a contribution:
moreover, in the voyage thither, they gained an additional
advantage by capturing, off the southern coast of the Propontis,
those eight Peloponnesian triremes which had accomplished, a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> little while before,
the revolt of Byzantium. But, on the other hand, as soon as the
Athenian fleet had left Sestos, Mindarus sailed from his station at
Abydos to Elæûs, and there recovered all the triremes captured from
him at Kynossêma, which the Athenians had there deposited, except
some of them which were so much damaged that the inhabitants of
Elæûs set them on fire.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153"
class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>But that which now began to constitute a far more important
element of the war, was, the difference of character between
Tissaphernês and Pharnabazus, and the transfer of the Peloponnesian
fleet from the satrapy of the former to that of the latter.
Tissaphernês, while furnishing neither aid nor pay to the
Peloponnesians, had by his treacherous promises and bribes enervated
all their proceedings for the last year, with the deliberate view of
wasting both the belligerent parties. Pharnabazus was a brave and
earnest man, who set himself to strengthen them strenuously, by men
as well as by money, and who labored hard to put down the Athenian
power; as we shall find him laboring equally hard, eighteen years
afterwards, to bring about its partial renovation. From this time
forward, Persian aid becomes a reality in the Grecian war; and in the
main—first, through the hands of Pharnabazus, next, through those of
the younger Cyrus—the determining reality. For we shall find that
while the Peloponnesians are for the most part well paid, out of the
Persian treasury, the Athenians, destitute of any such resource, are
compelled to rely on the contributions which they can levy here and
there, without established or accepted right; and to interrupt for
this purpose even the most promising career of success. Twenty-six
years after this, at a time when Sparta had lost her Persian allies,
the Lacedæmonian Teleutias tried to appease the mutiny of his
unpaid seamen, by telling them how much nobler it was to extort pay
from the enemy by means of their own swords, than to obtain it by
truckling to the foreigner;<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and probably the Athenian generals,
during these previous years of struggle, tried<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> similar appeals to the generosity of
their soldiers. But it is not the less certain, that the new constant
paymaster now introduced, gave fearful odds to the Spartan cause.</p>

<p>The good pay and hearty coöperation which the Peloponnesians
now enjoyed from Pharnabazus, only made them the more indignant at
the previous deceit of Tissaphernês. Under the influence of this
sentiment, they readily lent aid to the inhabitants of Antandrus in
expelling his general Arsakes with the Persian garrison. Arsakes had
recently committed an act of murderous perfidy, under the influence
of some unexplained pique, against the Delians established at
Adramyttium: he had summoned their principal citizens to take part as
allies in an expedition, and had caused them all to be surrounded,
shot down, and massacred during the morning meal. Such an act was
more than sufficient to excite hatred and alarm among the neighboring
Antandrians, who invited a body of Peloponnesian hoplites from
Abydos, across the mountain range of Ida, by whose aid Antandrus was
liberated from the Persians.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"
class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>In Milêtus, as well as in Knidus, Tissaphernês had already
experienced the like humiliation:<a id="FNanchor_156"
href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Lichas was no longer
alive to back his pretensions: nor do we hear that he obtained
any result from the complaints of his envoy Gaulites at Sparta.
Under these circumstances, he began to fear that he had incurred
a weight of enmity which might prove seriously mischievous, nor
was he without jealousy of the popularity and possible success of
Pharnabazus. The delusion respecting the Phenician fleet, now that
Mindarus had openly broken with him and quitted Milêtus, was no
longer available to any useful purpose. Accordingly, he dismissed
the Phenician fleet to their own homes, pretending to have received
tidings that the Phenician towns were endangered by sudden attacks
from Arabia and Egypt;<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"
class="fnanchor">[157]</a> while he himself quitted Aspendus to
revisit Ionia, as well as to go forward to the Hellespont, for the
purpose of renewing personal intercourse with the dissatisfied
Peloponnesians. He wished, while trying again<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> to excuse his own treachery about the
Phenician fleet, at the same time to protest against their recent
proceedings at Antandrus; or, at the least, to obtain some assurance
against any repetition of such hostility. His visit to Ionia,
however, seems to have occupied some time, and he tried to conciliate
the Ionic Greeks by a splendid sacrifice to Artemis at Ephesus.<a
id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
Having quitted Aspendus, as far as we can make out, about the
beginning of August<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p.
116]</span> (411 <small>B.C.</small>), he did not reach
the Hellespont until the month of November.<a id="FNanchor_159"
href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the Phenician fleet had disappeared, Alkibiadês
returned with his thirteen triremes from Phasêlis to Samos.
He too, like Tissaphernês, made the proceeding subservient to
deceit of his own: he took credit with his countrymen for having
enlisted the good-will of the satrap more strongly than ever in
the cause of Athens, and for having induced him to abandon his
intention of bringing up the Phenician fleet.<a id="FNanchor_160"
href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> At this time Dorieus
was at Rhodes with thirteen triremes, having been despatched by
Mindarus, before his departure from Milêtus, in order to stifle the
growth of a philo-Athenian party in the island. Perhaps the presence
of this force may have threatened the Athenian interest in Kos and
Halikarnassus; for we now find Alkibiadês going to these places from
Samos, with nine fresh triremes in addition to his own thirteen.
He erected fortifications at the town of Kos, and planted in it an
Athenian officer and garrison: from Halikarnassus he levied large
contributions; upon what pretence, or whether from simple want of
money, we do not know. It was towards the middle of September that
he returned to Samos.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"
class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>At the Hellespont, Mindarus had been reinforced after the battle
of Kynossêma by the squadron from Eubœa, at least by that portion
of it which had escaped the storm off Mount Athos. The departure of
the Peloponnesian fleet from Eubœa enabled the Athenians also to
send a few more ships to their fleet at Sestos. Thus ranged on the
opposite sides of the strait, the two fleets came to a second action,
wherein the Peloponnesians, under Agesandridas, had the advantage;
yet with little fruit. It was about the month of October, seemingly,
that Dorieus with his fourteen triremes came from Rhodes to rejoin
Mindarus at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span> the
Hellespont. He had hoped probably to get up the strait to Abydos
during the night, but he was caught by daylight a little way from
the entrance, near Rhœteium; and the Athenian scouts instantly gave
signal of his approach. Twenty Athenian triremes were despatched to
attack him: upon which Dorieus fled, and sought safety by hauling
his vessel ashore in the receding bay near Dardanus. The Athenian
squadron here attacked him, but were repulsed and forced to sail
back to Madytus. Mindarus was himself a spectator of this scene,
from a distance; being engaged in sacrificing to Athênê, on the
venerated hill of Ilium. He immediately hastened to Abydos, where
he fitted out his whole fleet of eighty-four triremes, Pharnabazus
coöperating on the shore with his land-force. Having rescued the
ships of Dorieus, his next care was to resist the entire Athenian
fleet, which presently came to attack him under Thrasybulus and
Thrasyllus. An obstinate naval combat took place between the two
fleets, which lasted nearly the whole day with doubtful issue;
at length, towards the evening, twenty fresh triremes were seen
approaching. They proved to be the squadron of Alkibiadês sailing
from Samos: having probably heard of the rejunction of the squadron
of Dorieus with the main Peloponnesian fleet, he had come with
his own counter-balancing reinforcement.<a id="FNanchor_162"
href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> As soon as his purple
flag or signal was ascertained, the Athenian fleet became animated
with redoubled spirit. The new-comers aided them in pressing the
action so vigorously, that the Peloponnesian fleet was driven back to
Abydos, and there run ashore. Here the Athenians still followed up
their success, and endeavored to tow them all off. But the Persian
land-force protected them, and Pharnabazus himself was seen foremost
in the combat; even pushing into the water in person, as far as his
horse could stand. The main Peloponnesian fleet was thus preserved;
yet the Athenians retired with an important victory, carrying
off thirty triremes as prizes, and retaking those which they had
themselves lost in the two preceding actions.<a id="FNanchor_163"
href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Mindarus kept his defeated fleet unemployed at Abydos during<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> the winter, sending to
Peloponnesus as well as among his allies to solicit reinforcements:
in the mean time, he engaged jointly with Pharnabazus in operations
by land against various Athenian allies on the continent. The
Athenian admirals, on their side, instead of keeping their fleet
united to prosecute the victory, were compelled to disperse a large
portion of it in flying squadrons, for collecting money, retaining
only forty sail at Sestos; while Thrasyllus in person went to Athens
to proclaim the victory and ask for reinforcements. Pursuant to
this request, thirty triremes were sent out under Theramenês; who
first endeavored without success to impede the construction of
the bridge between Eubœa and Bœotia, and next sailed on a voyage
among the islands for the purpose of collecting money. He acquired
considerable plunder by descents upon hostile territory, and also
extorted money from various parties, either contemplating or supposed
to contemplate revolt, among the dependencies of Athens. At Paros,
where the oligarchy established by Peisander in the conspiracy of the
Four Hundred still subsisted, Theramenês deposed and fined the men
who had exercised it, establishing a democracy in their room. From
hence he passed to Macedonia, to the assistance and probably into the
temporary pay of Archelaus, king of Macedonia, whom he aided for some
time in the siege of Pydna; blocking up the town by sea while the
Macedonians besieged it by land. The blockade having lasted the whole
winter, Theramenês was summoned away before its capture, to join
the main Athenian fleet in Thrace: Archelaus, however, took Pydna
not long afterwards, and transported the town with its residents
from the seaboard to a distance more than two miles inland.<a
id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> We
trace in all these proceedings the evidence of that terrible want
of money which now drove the Athenians to injustice, extortion, and
interference with their allies, such as they had never committed
during the earlier years of the war.</p>

<p>It is at this period that we find mention made of a fresh
intestine commotion in Korkyra, less stained, however, with savage
enormities than that recounted in the seventh year of the war. It
appears that the oligarchical party in the island, which had been
for the moment nearly destroyed at that period, had since<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span> gained strength, and
was encouraged by the misfortunes of Athens to lay plans for putting
the island into the hands of the Lacedæmonians. The democratical
leaders, apprized of this conspiracy, sent to Naupaktus for the
Athenian admiral Konon. He came, with a detachment of six hundred
Messenians, by the aid of whom they seized the oligarchical
conspirators in the market-place, putting a few to death, and
banishing more than a thousand. The extent of their alarm is attested
by the fact, that they liberated the slaves and conferred the right
of citizenship upon the foreigners. The exiles, having retired to the
opposite continent, came back shortly afterwards, and were admitted,
by the connivance of a party within, into the market-place. A serious
combat took place within the walls, which was at last made up by a
compromise and by the restoration of the exiles.<a id="FNanchor_165"
href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> We know nothing
about the particulars of this compromise, but it seems to have
been wisely drawn up and faithfully observed; for we hear nothing
about Korkyra until about thirty-five years after this period, and
the island is then presented to us as in the highest perfection of
cultivation and prosperity.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Doubtless the emancipation of slaves
and the admission of so many new foreigners to the citizenship,
contributed to this result.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tissaphernês, having completed his measures in Ionia,
arrived at the Hellespont not long after the battle of Abydos,
seemingly about November, 411 <small>B.C.</small> He was
anxious to regain some credit with the Peloponnesians, for which an
opportunity soon presented itself. Alkibiadês, then in command of the
Athenian fleet at Sestos, came to visit him in all the pride of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span> victory, bringing the
customary presents; but the satrap seized his person and sent him
away to Sardis as a prisoner in custody, affirming that he had the
Great King’s express orders for carrying on war with the Athenians.<a
id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
Here was an end of all the delusions of Alkibiadês, respecting
pretended power of influencing the Persian counsels. Yet these
delusions had already served his purpose by procuring for him a
renewed position in the Athenian camp, which his own military energy
enabled him to sustain and justify.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of this winter the superiority of the fleet of
Mindarus at Abydos, over the Athenian fleet at Sestos, had become so
great,—partly, as it would appear, through reinforcements obtained by
the former, partly through the dispersion of the latter into flying
squadrons from want of pay,—that the Athenians no longer dared to
maintain their position in the Hellespont. They sailed round the
southern point of the Chersonese, and took station at Kardia, on
the western side of the isthmus of that peninsula. Here, about the
commencement of spring, they were rejoined by Alkibiadês; who had
found means to escape from Sardis, along with Mantitheus, another
Athenian prisoner, first to Klazomenæ, and next to Lesbos, where he
collected a small squadron of five triremes. The dispersed squadrons
of the Athenian fleet being now all summoned to concentrate,
Theramenês came to Kardia from Macedonia, and Thrasybulus from
Thasos; whereby the Athenian fleet was rendered superior in number
to that of Mindarus. News was brought that the latter had moved with
his fleet from the Hellespont to Kyzikus, and was now engaged in
the siege of that place, jointly with Pharnabazus and the Persian
land-force.</p>

<p>His vigorous attacks had in fact already carried the place, when
the Athenian admirals resolved to attack him there, and contrived
to do it by surprise. Having passed first from Kardia to Elæûs
at the south of the Chersonese, they sailed up the Hellespont to
Prokonnesus by night, so that their passage escaped the notice
of the Peloponnesian guardships at Abydos.<a id="FNanchor_168"
href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span></p> <p>Resting at
Prokonnesus one night, and seizing every boat on the island, in
order that their movements might be kept secret, Alkibiadês warned
the assembled seamen that they must prepare for a sea-fight, a
land-fight, and a wall-fight, all at once. “We have no money (said
he), while our enemies have plenty from the Great King.” Neither zeal
in the men nor contrivance in the commanders was wanting. A body of
hoplites were landed on the mainland in the territory of Kyzikus,
for the purpose of operating a diversion; after which the fleet was
distributed into three divisions under Alkibiadês, Theramenês, and
Thrasybulus. The former, advancing near to Kyzikus with his single
division, challenged the fleet of Mindarus, and contrived to inveigle
him by pretended flight to a distance from the harbor; while the
other Athenian divisions, assisted by hazy and rainy weather, came up
unexpectedly, cut off his retreat, and forced him to run his ships
ashore on the neighboring mainland. After a gallant and hard-fought
battle, partly on shipboard, partly ashore,—at one time unpromising
to the Athenians, in spite of their superiority of number, but not
very intelligible in its details, and differently conceived by our
two authorities,—both the Peloponnesian fleet by sea and the forces
of Pharnabazus on land were completely defeated. Mindarus himself
was slain; and the entire fleet, every single trireme, was captured,
except the triremes of Syracuse, which were burnt by their own crews;
while Kyzikus itself surrendered to the Athenians, and submitted to a
large contribution, being spared from all other harm. The booty taken
by the victors was abundant and valuable. The numbers of the triremes
thus captured or destroyed is differently given; the lowest estimate
states it at sixty, the highest at eighty.<a id="FNanchor_169"
href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>This capital action, ably planned and bravely executed
by Alkibiadês and his two colleagues, about April 410
<small>B.C.</small>, changed sensibly the relative position of the
belligerents. The Peloponnesians had now no fleet of importance
in Asia, though they probably still retained a small squadron at
the station of Milêtus;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p.
122]</span> while the Athenian fleet was more powerful and menacing
than ever. The dismay of the defeated army is forcibly portrayed
in the laconic despatch sent by Hippokratês, secretary of the late
admiral Mindarus, to the ephors at Sparta: “All honor and advantage
are gone from us: Mindarus is slain: the men are starving: we are
in straits what to do.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a>” The ephors doubtless heard the same
deplorable tale from more than one witness; for this particular
despatch never reached them, having been intercepted and carried
to Athens. So discouraging was the view which they entertained of
the future, that a Lacedæmonian embassy, with Endius at their head,
came to Athens to propose peace; or rather perhaps Endius—ancient
friend and guest of Alkibiadês, who had already been at Athens as
envoy before—was allowed to come thither now again to sound the
temper of the city, in a sort of informal manner, which admitted of
being easily disavowed if nothing came of it. For it is remarkable
that Xenophon makes no mention of this embassy: and his silence,
though not sufficient to warrant us in questioning the reality of
the event,—which is stated by Diodorus, perhaps on the authority of
Theopompus, and is noway improbable in itself,—nevertheless, leads me
to doubt whether the ephors themselves admitted that they had made or
sanctioned the proposition. It is to be remembered that Sparta, not
to mention her obligation to her confederates generally, was at this
moment bound by special convention to Persia to conclude no separate
peace with Athens.</p>

<p>According to Diodorus, Endius, having been admitted to speak in
the Athenian assembly, invited the Athenians to make peace with
Sparta on the following terms: That each party should stand just as
they were; that the garrisons on both sides should be withdrawn;
that prisoners should be exchanged, one Lacedæmonian against one
Athenian. Endius insisted in his speech on the mutual mischief which
each was doing to the other by prolonging the war; but he contended
that Athens was by far the greater sufferer of the two, and had the
deepest interest in accelerating peace. She had no money, while
Sparta had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
Great King as a paymaster: she was robbed of the produce of Attica
by the garrison of Dekeleia, while Peloponnesus was undisturbed:
all her power and influence depended upon superiority at sea, which
Sparta could dispense with, and yet retain her pre-eminence.<a
id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>If we may believe Diodorus, all the most intelligent citizens in
Athens recommended that this proposition should be accepted. Only
the demagogues, the disturbers, those who were accustomed to blow up
the flames of war in order to obtain profit for themselves, opposed
it. Especially the demagogue Kleophon, now enjoying great influence,
enlarged upon the splendor of the recent victory, and upon the new
chances of success now opening to them: insomuch that the assembly
ultimately rejected the proposition of Endius.<a id="FNanchor_172"
href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>It was easy for those who wrote after the battle of Ægospotamos
and the capture of Athens, to be wise after the fact, and to repeat
the stock denunciations against an insane people, misled by a
corrupt demagogue. But if, abstracting from our knowledge of the
final close of the war, we look to the tenor of this proposition,
even assuming it to have been formal and authorized, as well as the
time at which it was made, we shall hesitate before we pronounce
Kleophon to have been foolish, much less corrupt, for recommending
its rejection. In reference to the charge of corrupt interest in the
continuance of war, I have already made some remarks about Kleon,
tending to show that no such interest can fairly be ascribed to
demagogues of that character<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a>. They were essentially unwarlike men,
and had quite as much chance personally of losing, as of gaining,
by a state of war. Especially this is true respecting Kleophon,
during the last years of the war, since the financial posture of
Athens was then so unprosperous, that all her available means were
exhausted to provide for ships and men, leaving little or no surplus
for political peculators. The admirals, who paid the seamen by
raising contributions abroad, might possibly enrich themselves, if
so inclined; but the politicians at home had much less chance of
such gains than they would have had in time of peace. Besides<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span> even if Kleophon were
ever so much a gainer by the continuance of war, yet, assuming Athens
to be ultimately crushed in the war, he was certain beforehand to be
deprived, not only of all his gains and his position, but of his life
also.</p>

<p>So much for the charge against him of corrupt interest. The
question whether his advice was judicious, is not so easy to
dispose of. Looking to the time when the proposition was made, we
must recollect that the Peloponnesian fleet in Asia had been just
annihilated, and that the brief epistle itself, from Hippokratês
to the ephors, divulging in so emphatic a manner the distress of
his troops, was at this moment before the Athenian assembly. On the
other hand, the despatches of the Athenian generals, announcing
their victory, had excited a sentiment of universal triumph,
manifested by public thanksgiving, at Athens:<a id="FNanchor_174"
href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> nor can we doubt
that Alkibiadês and his colleagues promised a large career of coming
success, perhaps the recovery of most part of the lost maritime
empire. In this temper of the Athenian people and of their generals,
justified as it was to a great degree by the reality, what is the
proposition which comes from Endius? What he proposes, is, in
reality, no concession at all. Both parties to stand in their actual
position; to withdraw garrisons; to restore prisoners. There was
only one way in which Athens would have been a gainer by accepting
these propositions. She would have withdrawn her garrison from Pylos,
she would have been relieved from the garrison of Dekeleia; such an
exchange would have been a considerable advantage to her. To this we
must add the relief arising from simple cessation of war, doubtless
real and important.</p>

<p>Now the question is, whether a statesman like Periklês would
have advised his countrymen to be satisfied with such a measure of
concession, immediately after the great victory of Kyzikus, and
the two smaller victories preceding it? I incline to believe that
he would not. It would rather have appeared to him in the light of
a diplomatic artifice, calculated to paralyze Athens during the
interval while her enemies were defenceless, and to gain time for
them to build a new fleet.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Sparta could not pledge herself<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> either for Persia,
or for her Peloponnesian confederates; indeed, past experience
had shown that she could not do so with effect. By accepting the
propositions, therefore, Athens would not really have obtained relief
from the entire burden of war; but would merely have blunted the
ardor and tied up the hands of her own troops, at a moment when they
felt themselves in the full current of success. By the armament,
most certainly,—and by the generals, Alkibiadês, Theramenês, and
Thrasybulus,—the acceptance of such terms at such a moment would have
been regarded as a disgrace. It would have balked them of conquests
ardently, and at that time not unreasonably, anticipated; conquests
tending to restore Athens to that eminence from which she had been so
recently deposed. And it would have inflicted this mortification, not
merely without compensating gain to her in any other shape, but with
a fair probability of imposing upon all her citizens the necessity
of redoubled efforts at no very distant future, when the moment
favorable to her enemies should have arrived.</p>

<p>If, therefore, passing from the vague accusation that it was the
demagogue Kleophon who stood between Athens and the conclusion of
peace, we examine what were the specific terms of peace which he
induced his countrymen to reject, we shall find that he had very
strong reasons, not to say preponderant reasons, for his advice.
Whether he made any use of this proposition, in itself inadmissible,
to try and invite the conclusion of peace on more suitable and
lasting terms, may well be doubted. Probably no such efforts would
have succeeded, even if they had been made; yet a statesman like
Periklês would have made the trial, in a conviction that Athens was
carrying on the war at a disadvantage which must in the long run sink
her. A mere opposition speaker, like Kleophon, even when taking what
was probably a right measure of the actual proposition before him,
did not look so far forward into the future.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Athenian fleet reigned alone in the Propontis
and its two adjacent straits, the Bosphorus and the Hellespont;
although the ardor and generosity of Pharnabazus not only sup<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span>plied maintenance and
clothing to the distressed seamen of the vanquished fleet, but also
encouraged the construction of fresh ships in the room of those
captured. While he armed the seamen, gave them pay for two months,
and distributed them as guards along the coast of the satrapy, he
at the same time granted an unlimited supply of ship-timber from
the abundant forests of Mount Ida, and assisted the officers in
putting new triremes on the stocks at Antandrus; near to which, at
a place called Aspaneus, the Idæan wood was chiefly exported.<a
id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>Having made these arrangements, he proceeded to lend aid at
Chalkêdon, which the Athenians had already begun to attack. Their
first operation after the victory, had been to sail to Perinthus and
Selymbria, both of which had before revolted from Athens: the former,
intimidated by the recent events, admitted them and rejoined itself
to Athens; the latter resisted such a requisition, but ransomed
itself from attack for the present, by the payment of a pecuniary
fine. Alkibiadês then conducted them to Chalkêdon, opposite to
Byzantium on the southernmost Asiatic border of the Bosphorus. To be
masters of these two straits, the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, was
a point of first-rate moment to Athens; first, because it enabled
her to secure the arrival of the corn ships from the Euxine, for her
own consumption; next, because she had it in her power to impose a
tithe or due upon all the trading ships passing through, not unlike
the dues imposed by the Danes at the Sound, even down to the present
time. For the opposite reasons, of course, the importance of the
position was equally great to the enemies of Athens. Until the spring
of the preceding year, Athens had been undisputed mistress of both
the straits. But the revolt of Abydos in the Hellespont (about April,
411 <small>B.C.</small>) and that of Byzantium with Chalkêdon in the
Bosphorus (about June, 411 <small>B.C.</small>), had deprived her
of this pre-eminence; and her supplies drained during the last few
months could only have come through during those intervals when her
fleets there stationed had the preponderance, so as to give them
convoy. Accordingly, it is highly probable that her supplies of corn
from the Euxine during the autumn of 411 <small>B.C.</small>, had
been comparatively restricted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span></p>

<p>Though Chalkêdon itself, assisted by Pharnabazus, still held out
against Athens, Alkibiadês now took possession of Chrysopolis, its
unfortified seaport, on the eastern coast of the Bosphorus opposite
Byzantium. This place he fortified, established in it a squadron with
a permanent garrison, and erected it into a regular tithing-port
for levying toll on all vessels coming out of the Euxine.<a
id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
The Athenians seem to have habitually levied this toll at Byzantium,
until the revolt of that place, among their constant sources of
revenue: it was now reëstablished under the auspices of Alkibiadês.
In so far as it was levied on ships which brought their produce for
sale and consumption at Athens, it was of course ultimately paid in
the shape of increased price by Athenian citizens and metics. Thirty
triremes under Theramenês, were left at Chrysopolis to enforce this
levy, to convoy friendly merchantmen, and in other respects to serve
as annoyance to the enemy.</p>

<p>The remaining fleet went partly to the Hellespont, partly to
Thrace, where the diminished maritime strength of the Lacedæmonians
already told in respect to the adherence of the cities. At
Thasus, especially,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"
class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the citizens, headed by Ekphantus,
expelled the Lacedæmonian harmost Eteonikus with his garrison, and
admitted Thrasybulus with an Athenian force. It will be recollected
that this was one of the cities in which Peisander and the Four
Hundred conspirators (early in 411 <small>B.C.</small>)
had put down the democracy and established an oligarchical
government, under pretence that the allied cities would be faithful
to Athens as soon as she was relieved from her democratical
institutions. All the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p.
128]</span> calculations of these oligarchs had been disappointed,
as Phrynichus had predicted from the first: the Thasians, as soon as
their own oligarchical party had been placed in possession of the
government, recalled their disaffected exiles,<a id="FNanchor_179"
href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> under whose auspices
a Laconian garrison and harmost had since been introduced. Eteonikus,
now expelled, accused the Lacedæmonian admiral Pasippidas of being
himself a party to the expulsion, under bribes from Tissaphernês;
an accusation which seems improbable, but which the Lacedæmonians
believed, and accordingly banished Pasippidas, sending Kratesippidas
to replace him. The new admiral found at Chios a small fleet
which Pasippidas had already begun to collect from the allies, to
supply the recent losses.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>The tone at Athens since the late naval victories, had become
more hopeful and energetic. Agis, with his garrison at Dekeleia,
though the Athenians could not hinder him from ravaging Attica, yet
on approaching one day near to the city walls, was repelled with
spirit and success by Thrasyllus. But that which most mortified the
Lacedæmonian king, was to discern from his lofty station at Dekeleia,
the abundant influx into the Peiræus of corn-ships from the Euxine,
again renewed in the autumn of 410 <small>B.C.</small> since the
occupation of the Bosphorus and Hellespont by Alkibiadês. For the
safe reception of these vessels, Thorikus was soon after fortified.
Agis exclaimed that it was fruitless to shut out the Athenians
from the produce of Attica, so long as plenty of imported corn was
allowed to reach them. Accordingly, he provided, in conjunction with
the Megarians, a small squadron of fifteen triremes, with which he
despatched Klearchus to Byzantium and Chalkêdon. That Spartan was
a public guest of the Byzantines, and had already been singled out
to command auxiliaries intended for that city. He seems to have
begun his voyage during the ensuing winter (<small>B.C.</small>
410-409), and reached Byzantium in safety, though with the
destruction of three of his squadron by the nine Athenian triremes
who guarded the Hellespont.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span></p> <p>In the
ensuing spring, Thrasyllus was despatched from Athens at the head
of a large new force to act in Ionia. He commanded fifty triremes,
one thousand of the regular hoplites, one hundred horsemen, and
five thousand seamen, with the means of arming these latter as
peltasts; also transports for his troops besides the triremes.<a
id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Having reposed his armament for three days at Samos, he made a
descent at Pygela, and next succeeded in making himself master of
Kolophon, with its port Notium. He next threatened Ephesus, but
that place was defended by a powerful force which Tissaphernês had
summoned, under proclamation “to go and succor the goddess Artemis;”
as well as by twenty-five fresh Syracusan and two Selinusian
triremes recently arrived.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a> From these enemies, Thrasyllus sustained
a severe defeat near Ephesus, lost three hundred men, and was
compelled to sail off to Notium; from whence, after burying his
dead, he proceeded northward towards the Hellespont. On their way
thither, while halting for a while at Methymna in the north of
Lesbos, Thrasyllus saw the twenty-five Syracusan triremes passing
by on their voyage from Ephesus to Abydos. He immediately attacked
them, captured four along with the entire crews, and chased the
remainder back to their station at Ephesus. All the prisoners taken
were sent to Athens, where they were deposited for custody in the
stone-quarries of Peiræus, doubtless in retaliation for the treatment
of the Athenian prisoners at Syracuse; they contrived, however,
during the ensuing winter, to break a way out and escape to Dekeleia.
Among the prisoners taken, was found Alkibiadês, the Athenian, cousin
and fellow-exile of the Athe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p.
130]</span>nian general of the same name, whom Thrasyllus caused
to be set at liberty, while the others were sent to Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>After the delay caused by this pursuit, he brought back his
armament to the Hellespont and joined the force of Alkibiadês at
Sestos. Their joint force was conveyed over, seemingly about the
commencement of autumn, to Lampsakus, on the Asiatic side of the
strait; which place they fortified and made their head-quarters
for the autumn and winter, maintaining themselves by predatory
excursions, throughout the neighboring satrapy of Pharnabazus. It
is curious to learn, however, that when Alkibiadês was proceeding
to marshal them all together,—the hoplites, according to Athenian
custom, taking rank according to their tribes,—his own soldiers,
never yet beaten, refused to fraternize with those of Thrasyllus,
who had been so recently worsted at Ephesus. Nor was this alienation
removed until after a joint expedition against Abydos; Pharnabazus
presenting himself with a considerable force, especially cavalry, to
relieve that place, was encountered and defeated in a battle wherein
all the Athenians present took part. The honor of the hoplites of
Thrasyllus was now held to be reëstablished, so that the fusion of
ranks was admitted without farther difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_185"
href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Even the entire army,
however, was not able to accomplish the conquest of Abydos; which the
Peloponnesians and Pharnabazus still maintained as their station on
the Hellespont.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Athens had so stripped herself of force, by the large
armament recently sent with Thrasyllus, that her enemies near home
were encouraged to active operations. The Spartans despatched an
expedition, both of triremes and of land-force, to attack Pylos,
which had remained as an Athenian post and a refuge for revolted
Helots ever since its first fortification by Demosthenês, in
<small>B.C.</small> 425. The place was vigorously attacked, both by
sea and by land, and soon became much pressed. Not unmindful of its
distress, the Athenians sent to its relief thirty triremes under
Anytus, who, however, came back without even reaching the place,
having been prevented by stormy weather or unfavorable winds from
doubling Cape Malea. Pylos was soon after<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_131">[p. 131]</span>wards obliged to surrender, the
garrison departing on terms of capitulation.<a id="FNanchor_186"
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> But Anytus, on his
return, encountered great displeasure from his countrymen, and was
put on his trial for having betrayed, or for not having done his
utmost to fulfil, the trust confided to him. It is said that he only
saved himself from condemnation by bribing the dikastery, and that he
was the first Athenian who ever obtained a verdict by corruption.<a
id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Whether he could really have reached Pylos, and whether the obstacles
which baffled him were such as an energetic officer would have
overcome, we have no means of determining; still less, whether it be
true that he actually escaped by bribery. The story seems to prove,
however, that the general Athenian public thought him deserving of
condemnation, and were so much surprised by his acquittal, as to
account for it by supposing, truly or falsely, the use of means never
before attempted.</p>

<p>It was about the same time, also, that the Megarians recovered
by surprise their port of Nisæa, which had been held by an Athenian
garrison since <small>B.C.</small> 424. The Athenians
made an effort to recover it, but failed; though they defeated the
Megarians in an action.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"
class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Thrasyllus, during the summer of <small>B.C.</small>
409, and even the joint force of Thrasyllus and Alkibiadês during
the autumn of the same year, seem to have effected less than might
have been expected from so large a force: indeed, it must have been
at some period during this year that the Lacedæmonian Klearchus,
with his fifteen Megarian ships, penetrated up the Hellespont to
Byzantium, finding it guarded only by nine Athenian triremes.<a
id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
But the operations of 408 <small>B.C.</small> were
more important. The entire force under Alkibiadês and the other
commanders was mustered for the siege of Chalkêdon and Byzantium.
The Chalkêdonians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p.
132]</span> having notice of the project, deposited their movable
property for safety in the hand of their neighbors the Bithynian
Thracians; a remarkable evidence of the good feeling and confidence
between the two, contrasting strongly with the perpetual hostility
which subsisted on the other side of the Bosphorus between
Byzantium and the Thracian tribes adjoining.<a id="FNanchor_190"
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But the precaution
was frustrated by Alkibiadês, who entered the territory of the
Bithynians and compelled them by threats to deliver up the effects
confided to them. He then proceeded to block up Chalkêdon by a wooden
wall carried across from the Bosphorus to the Propontis; though the
continuity of this wall was interrupted by a river, and seemingly by
some rough ground on the immediate brink of the river. The blockading
wall was already completed, when Pharnabazus appeared with an army
for the relief of the place, and advanced as far as the Herakleion,
or temple of Heraklês, belonging to the Chalkêdonians. Profiting by
his approach, Hippokratês, the Lacedæmonian harmost in the town,
made a vigorous sally: but the Athenians repelled all the efforts
of Pharnabazus to force a passage through their lines and join him;
so that, after an obstinate contest, the sallying force was driven
back within the walls of the town, and Hippokratês himself killed.<a
id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The blockade of the town was now made so sure, that Alkibiadês
departed with a portion of the army to levy money and get together
forces for the siege of Byzantium afterwards. During his absence,
Theramenês and Thrasybulus came to terms with Pharnabazus for the
capitulation of Chalkêdon. It was agreed that the town should
again become a tributary dependency of Athens, on the same rate
of tribute as before the revolt, and that the arrears during the
subsequent period should be paid up. Moreover, Pharnabazus himself
engaged to pay to the Athenians twenty talents on behalf of the
town, and also to escort some Athenian envoys up to Susa, enabling
them to submit propositions for accommodation to the Great King.
Until those envoys should return, the Athenians covenanted to
abstain from hostilities against the satrapy of Pharnabazus.<a
id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
Oaths to this effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p.
133]</span> were mutually exchanged, after the return of Alkibiadês
from his expedition. For Pharnabazus positively refused to complete
the ratification with the other generals, until Alkibiadês should
be there to ratify in person also; a proof at once of the great
individual importance of the latter, and of his known facility in
finding excuses to evade an agreement. Two envoys were accordingly
sent by Pharnabazus to Chrysopolis, to receive the oaths of
Alkibiadês, while two relatives of Alkibiadês came to Chalkêdon as
witnesses to those of Pharnabazus. Over and above the common oath
shared with his colleagues, Alkibiadês took a special covenant of
personal friendship and hospitality with the satrap, and received
from him the like.</p>

<p>Alkibiadês had employed his period of absence in capturing
Selymbria, from whence he obtained a sum of money, and in getting
together a large body of Thracians, with whom he marched by land
to Byzantium. That place was now besieged, immediately after the
capitulation of Chalkêdon, by the united force of the Athenians. A
wall of circumvallation was drawn around it, and various attacks
were made by missiles and battering engines. These, however, the
Lacedæmonian garrison, under the harmost Klearchus, aided by some
Megarians under Helixus, and Bœotians under Kœratadas, was perfectly
competent to repel. But the ravages of famine were not so easily
dealt with. After the blockade had lasted some time, provisions began
to fail; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> that
Klearchus, strict and harsh, even under ordinary circumstances,
became inexorable and oppressive, from exclusive anxiety for the
subsistence of his soldiers; and even locked up the stock of food
while the population of the town were dying of hunger around him.
Seeing that his only hope was from external relief, he sallied forth
from the city to entreat aid from Pharnabazus; and to get together,
if possible, a fleet for some aggressive operation that might divert
the attention of the besiegers. He left the defence to Kœratadas
and Helixus, in full confidence that the Byzantines were too much
compromised by their revolt from Athens to venture to desert Sparta,
whatever might be their suffering. But the favorable terms recently
granted to Chalkêdon, coupled with the severe and increasing famine,
induced Kydon and a Byzantine party to open the gates by night, and
admit Alkibiadês with the Athenians into the wide interior square
called the Thrakion. Helixus and Kœratadas, apprized of this attack
only when the enemy had actually got possession of the town on all
sides, vainly attempted resistance, and were compelled to surrender
at discretion: they were sent as prisoners to Athens, where Kœratadas
contrived to escape during the confusion of the landing at Peiræus.
Favorable terms were granted to the town, which was replaced in
its position of a dependent ally of Athens, and probably had to
pay up its arrears of tribute in the same manner as Chalkêdon.<a
id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>So slow was the process of siege in ancient times, that the
reduction of Chalkêdon and Byzantium occupied nearly the whole year;
the latter place surrendering about the beginning of winter.<a
id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
Both of them, however, were acquisitions of capital importance to
Athens, making her again undisputed mistress of the Bosphorus, and
insuring to her two valuable tributary allies. Nor was this all
the improvement which the summer had operated in her position.
The accommodation just concluded with Pharnabazus was also a
step of great value, and still greater<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span> promise. It was plain that the satrap
had grown weary of bearing all the brunt of the war for the benefit
of the Peloponnesians, and that he was well disposed to assist the
Athenians in coming to terms with the Great King. The mere withdrawal
of his hearty support from Sparta, even if nothing else followed
from it, was of immense moment to Athens; and thus much was really
achieved. The envoys, five Athenians and two Argeians,—all, probably,
sent for from Athens, which accounts for some delay,—were directed,
after the siege of Chalkêdon, to meet Pharnabazus at Kyzikus. Some
Lacedæmonian envoys, and even the Syracusan Hermokratês, who had
been condemned and banished by sentence at home, took advantage
of the same escort, and all proceeded on their journey upward to
Susa. Their progress was arrested, during the extreme severity of
the winter, at Gordium in Phrygia; and it was while pursuing their
track into the interior at the opening of spring, that they met the
young prince Cyrus, son of king Darius, coming down in person to
govern an important part of Asia Minor. Some Lacedæmonian envoys,
Bœotius and others, were travelling down along with him, after having
fulfilled their mission at the Persian court.<a id="FNanchor_195"

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER LXIV.<br />
  FROM THE ARRIVAL OF CYRUS THE YOUNGER IN ASIA MINOR,
  DOWN TO THE BATTLE OF ARGINUSÆ.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> advent of Cyrus,
commonly known as Cyrus the younger, into Asia Minor, was an event of
the greatest importance, opening what may be called the last phase in
the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>He was the younger of the two sons of the Persian king Darius
Nothus by the cruel queen Parysatis, and was now sent down by his
father as satrap of Lydia, Phrygia the greater, and Kappadokia,
as well as general of all that military division of which the
muster-place was Kastôlus. His command did not at this<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span> time comprise the
Greek cities on the coast, which were still left to Tissaphernês
and Pharnabazus.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But he nevertheless brought down with him
a strong interest in the Grecian war, and an intense anti-Athenian
feeling, with full authority from his father to carry it out into
act. Whatever this young man willed, he willed strongly; his
bodily activity, rising superior to those temptations of sensual
indulgence which often enervated the Persian grandees, provoked the
admiration even of Spartans:<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197"
class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and his energetic character was combined
with a certain measure of ability. Though he had not as yet conceived
that deliberate plan for mounting the Persian throne which afterwards
absorbed his whole mind, and was so near succeeding by the help of
the Ten Thousand Greeks, yet he seems to have had from the beginning
the sentiment and ambition of a king in prospect, not those of a
satrap. He came down, well aware that Athens was the efficient
enemy by whom the pride of the Persian kings had been humbled, the
insular Greeks kept out of the sight of a Persian ship, and even the
continental Greeks on the coast practically emancipated, for the last
sixty years. He therefore brought down with him a strenuous desire
to put down the Athenian power, very different from the treacherous
balancing of Tissaphernês, and much more formidable even than the
straightforward enmity of Pharnabazus, who had less money, less favor
at court, and less of youthful ardor. Moreover, Pharnabazus, after
having heartily espoused the cause of the Peloponnesians for the
last three years, had now become weary of the allies whom he had so
long kept in pay. Instead of expelling Athenian influence from his
coasts with little difficulty, as he had expected to do, he found
his satrapy plundered, his revenues impaired or absorbed, and an
Athenian fleet all-powerful in the Propontis and Hellespont; while
the Lacedæmonian fleet, which he had taken so much pains to invite,
was destroyed. Decidedly sick of the Peloponnesian cause, he was
even leaning towards Athens; and the envoys whom he was escorting to
Susa might perhaps have laid the foundation of an altered Persian
policy in Asia Minor, when the journey of Cyrus<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> down to the coast overthrew all such
calculations. The young prince brought with him a fresh, hearty, and
youthful antipathy against Athens, a power inferior only to that of
the Great King himself, and an energetic determination to use it
without reserve in insuring victory to the Peloponnesians.</p>

<p>From the moment that Pharnabazus and the Athenian envoys met
Cyrus, their farther progress towards Susa became impossible.
Bœotius, and the other Lacedæmonian envoys travelling along with
the young prince, made extravagant boasts of having obtained all
that they asked for at Susa; and Cyrus himself announced his powers
as unlimited in extent over the whole coast, all for the purpose
of prosecuting vigorous war in conjunction with the Lacedæmonians.
Pharnabazus, on hearing this intelligence, and seeing the Great
King’s seal to the words, “I send down Cyrus, as lord of all those
who muster at Kastôlus,” not only refused to let the Athenian envoys
proceed onward, but was even obliged to obey the orders of the young
prince, who insisted that they should either be surrendered to him,
or at least detained for some time in the interior, in order that
no information might be conveyed to Athens. The satrap resisted
the first of these requisitions, having pledged his word for their
safety; but he obeyed the second, detaining them in Kappadokia for no
less than three years, until Athens was prostrate and on the point
of surrender, after which he obtained permission from Cyrus to send
them back to the sea-coast.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198"
class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>This arrival of Cyrus, overruling the treachery of Tissaphernês
as well as the weariness of Pharnabazus, and supplying the enemies
of Athens with a double flow of Persian gold at a moment when the
stream would otherwise have dried up, was a paramount item in that
sum of causes which concurred to determine the result of the war.<a
id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> But
important as the event was in itself, it was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> rendered still more important by the
character of the Lacedæmonian admiral Lysander, with whom the young
prince first came into contact on reaching Sardis.</p>

<p>Lysander had come out to supersede Kratesippidas, about December,
408 <small>B.C.</small>, or January, 407 <small>B.C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> He
was the last, after Brasidas and Gylippus, of that trio of eminent
Spartans, from whom all the capital wounds of Athens proceeded,
during the course of this long war. He was born of poor parents,
and is even said to have been of that class called mothakes, being
only enabled by the aid of richer men to keep up his contribution
to the public mess, and his place in the constant drill and
discipline. He was not only an excellent officer,<a id="FNanchor_201"
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> thoroughly competent
to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> duties
of military command, but possessed also great talents for intrigue,
and for organizing a political party as well as keeping up its
disciplined movements. Though indifferent to the temptations either
of money or of pleasure,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and willingly acquiescing in the poverty
to which he was born, he was altogether unscrupulous in the
prosecution of ambitious objects, either for his country or for
himself. His family, poor as it was, enjoyed a dignified position
at Sparta, belonging to the gens of the Herakleidæ, not connected
by any near relationship with the kings: moreover, his personal
reputation as a Spartan was excellent, since his observance of the
rules of discipline had been rigorous and exemplary. The habits of
self-constraint thus acquired, served him in good stead when it
became necessary to his ambition to court the favor of the great.
His recklessness about falsehood and perjury is illustrated by
various current sayings ascribed to him; such as, that children
were to be taken in by means of dice; men, by means of oaths.<a
id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> A
selfish ambition—for promoting the power of his country not merely in
connection with, but in subservience to, his own—guided him from the
beginning to the end of his career. In this main quality, he agreed
with Alkibiadês; in reckless immorality of means, he went even beyond
him. He seems to have been cruel; an attribute which formed no part
of the usual character of Alkibiadês. On the other hand, the love
of personal enjoyment, luxury, and ostentation, which counted for
so much in Alkibiadês, was quite unknown to Lysander. The basis of
his disposition was Spartan, tending to merge appetite, ostentation,
and expansion of mind, all in the love of command and influence,—not
Athenian, which tended to the development of many and diversified
impulses; ambition being one, but only one, among the number.</p>

<p>Kratesippidas, the predecessor of Lysander, seems to have enjoyed
the maritime command for more than the usual yearly period, having
superseded Pasippidas during the middle of the year of the latter.
But the maritime power of Sparta was then so weak, having not yet
recovered from the ruinous defeat at Kyzikus, that he achieved little
or nothing. We hear of him only as further<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>ing, for his own profit, a political
revolution at Chios. Bribed by a party of Chian exiles, he took
possession of the acropolis, reinstated them in the island, and
aided them in deposing and expelling the party then in office, to
the number of six hundred. It is plain that this is not a question
between democracy and oligarchy, but between two oligarchical
parties, the one of which succeeded in purchasing the factious
agency of the Spartan admiral. The exiles whom he expelled took
possession of Atarneus, a strong post belonging to the Chians on
the mainland opposite Lesbos. From hence they made war, as well as
they could, upon their rivals now in possession of the island, and
also upon other parts of Ionia; not without some success and profit,
as will appear by their condition about ten years afterwards.<a
id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>The practice of reconstituting the governments of the Asiatic
cities, thus begun by Kratesippidas, was extended and brought to
a system by Lysander; not indeed for private emolument, which he
always despised, but in views of ambition. Having departed from
Peloponnesus with a squadron, he reinforced it at Rhodes, and then
sailed onward to Kos—an Athenian island, so that he could only have
touched there—and Milêtus. He took up his final station at Ephesus,
the nearest point to Sardis, where Cyrus was expected to arrive;
and while awaiting his coming, augmented his fleet to the number of
seventy triremes. As soon as Cyrus reached Sardis, about April or
May 407 <small>B.C.</small>, Lysander went to pay his
court to him, along with some Lacedæmonian envoys, and found himself
welcomed with every mark of favor. Preferring bitter complaints
against the double-dealing of Tissaphernês,—whom they accused of
having frustrated the king’s orders, and sacrificed the interests of
the empire, under the seductions of Alkibiadês,—they intreated Cyrus
to adopt a new policy, and execute the stipulations of the treaty,
by lending the most vigorous aid to put down the common enemy. Cyrus
replied, that these were the express orders which he had received
from his father, and that he was prepared to fulfil them with all
his might. He had brought with him, he said, five hundred talents,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> should be
at once devoted to the cause: if these were insufficient, he would
resort to the private funds which his father had given him; and if
more still were needed, he would coin into money the gold and silver
throne on which he sat.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Lysander and the envoys returned the warmest thanks for these
magnificent promises, which were not likely to prove empty words from
the lips of a vehement youth like Cyrus. So sanguine were the hopes
which they conceived from his character and proclaimed sentiments,
that they ventured to ask him to restore the rate of pay to one
full Attic drachma per head for the seamen; which had been the rate
promised by Tissaphernês through his envoys at Sparta, when he first
invited the Lacedæmonians across the Ægean, and when it was doubtful
whether they would come, but actually paid only for the first month,
and then reduced to half a drachma, furnished in practice with
miserable irregularity. As a motive for granting this increase of
pay, Cyrus was assured that it would determine the Athenian seamen to
desert so largely, that the war would sooner come to an end, and of
course the expenditure also. But he refused compliance, saying that
the rate of pay had been fixed both by the king’s express orders and
by the terms of the treaty, so that he could not depart from it.<a
id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> In
this reply Lysander was forced to acquiesce. The envoys were treated
with distinction, and feasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p.
142]</span> at a banquet; after which Cyrus, drinking to the health
of Lysander, desired him to declare what favor he could do to
gratify him most. “To grant an additional obolus per head for each
seaman’s pay,” replied Lysander. Cyrus immediately complied, having
personally bound himself by his manner of putting the question. But
the answer impressed him both with astonishment and admiration;
for he had expected that Lysander would ask some favor or present
for himself, judging him not only according to the analogy of most
Persians, but also of Astyochus and the officers of the Peloponnesian
armament at Milêtus, whose corrupt subservience to Tissaphernês had
probably been made known to him. From such corruption, as well as
from the mean carelessness of Theramenês, the Spartan, respecting the
condition of the seamen,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Lysander’s conduct stood out in pointed
and honorable contrast.</p>

<p>The incident here described not only procured for the seamen
of the Peloponnesian fleet the daily pay of four oboli, instead
of three, per man, but also insured to Lysander himself a degree
of esteem and confidence from Cyrus which he knew well how to
turn to account. I have already remarked,<a id="FNanchor_208"
href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> in reference to
Periklês and Nikias, that an established reputation for personal
incorruptibility, rare as that quality was among Grecian leading
politicians, was among the most precious items in the capital
stock of an ambitious man, even if looked at only in regard
to the durability of his own influence. If the proof of such
disinterestedness was of so much value in the eyes of the Athenian
people, yet more powerfully did it work upon the mind of Cyrus. With
his Persian and princely ideas of winning adherents by munificence,<a
id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
a man who despised presents was a phenomenon<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> commanding the higher sentiment of
wonder and respect. From this time forward he not only trusted
Lysander with implicit pecuniary confidence, but consulted him
as to the prosecution of the war, and even condescended to
second his personal ambition to the detriment of this object.<a
id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Returning from Sardis to Ephesus, after such unexampled success
in his interview with Cyrus, Lysander was enabled not only to make
good to his fleet the full arrear actually due, but also to pay them
for a month in advance, at the increased rate of four oboli per man;
and to promise that high rate for the future. A spirit of the highest
satisfaction and confidence was diffused through the armament. But
the ships were in indifferent condition, having been hastily and
parsimoniously got up since the late defeat at Kyzikus. Accordingly,
Lysander employed his present affluence in putting them into better
order, procuring more complete tackle, and inviting picked crews.<a
id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
He took another step pregnant with important results. Summoning
to Ephesus a few of the most leading and active men from each of
the Asiatic cities, he organized them into disciplined clubs, or
factions, in correspondence with himself. He instigated these
clubs to the most vigorous prosecution of the war against Athens,
promising that, as soon as that war should be concluded, they should
be invested and maintained by Spartan influence in the government of
their respective cities.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a> His newly established influence with
Cyrus, and the abundant supplies of which he was now master, added
double force to an invitation in itself but too seducing. And thus,
while infusing increased ardor into the joint warlike efforts of
these cities, he at the same time procured for himself an ubiquitous
correspondence, such as no successor could manage, rendering the
continuance of his own command almost essential to success. The
fruits of his factious manœuvres will be seen in the subsequent
dekadarchies, or oligarchies of Ten, after the complete subjugation
of Athens.</p>

<p>While Lysander and Cyrus were thus restoring formidable efficacy
to their side of the contest, during the summer of 407<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span> <small>B.C.</small>,
the victorious exile Alkibiadês had accomplished the important and
delicate step of reëntering his native city for the first time.
According to the accommodation with Pharnabazus, concluded after
the reduction of Chalkêdon, the Athenian fleet was precluded from
assailing his satrapy, and was thus forced to seek subsistence
elsewhere. Byzantium and Selymbria, with contributions levied
in Thrace, maintained them for the winter: in the spring (407
<small>B.C.</small>), Alkibiadês brought them again to Samos; from
whence he undertook an expedition against the coast of Karia, levying
contributions to the extent of one hundred talents. Thrasybulus, with
thirty triremes, went to attack Thrace, where he reduced Thasos,
Abdêra, and all those towns which had revolted from Athens; Thasos
being now in especial distress from famine as well as from past
seditions. A valuable contribution for the support of the fleet was
doubtless among the fruits of this success. Thrasyllus at the same
time conducted another division of the army home to Athens, intended
by Alkibiadês as precursors of his own return.<a id="FNanchor_213"
href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Before Thrasyllus arrived, the people had already manifested their
favorable disposition towards Alkibiadês by choosing him anew general
of the armament, along with Thrasybulus and Konon. Alkibiadês was now
tending homeward from Samos with twenty triremes, bringing with him
all the contributions recently levied: he first stopped at Paros,
then visited the coast of Laconia, and lastly looked into the harbor
of Gytheion in Laconia, where he had learned that thirty triremes
were preparing. The news which he received of his reëlection as
general, strengthened by the pressing invitations and encouragements
of his friends, as well as by the recall of his banished kinsmen at
length determined him to sail to Athens. He reached Peiræus on a
marked day, the festival of the Plyntêria, on the 25th of the month
Thargêlion, about the end of May, 407 <small>B.C.</small> This was a
day of melancholy solemnity, accounted unpropitious for any action of
importance. The statue of the goddess Athênê was stripped of all its
ornaments, covered up from every one’s gaze,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> and washed or cleansed under a
mysterious ceremonial, by the holy gens, called Praxiergidæ. The
goddess thus seemed to turn away her face, and refuse to behold the
returning exile. Such at least was the construction of his enemies;
and as the subsequent turn of events tended to bear them out, it has
been preserved; while the more auspicious counter-interpretation,
doubtless suggested by his friends, has been forgotten.</p>

<p>The most extravagant representations, of the pomp and splendor
of this return of Alkibiadês to Athens, were given by some authors
of antiquity, especially by Duris of Samos, an author about two
generations later. It was said that he brought with him two hundred
prow-ornaments belonging to captive enemies’ ships, or, according
to some, even the two hundred captured ships themselves; that his
trireme was ornamented with gilt and silvered shields, and sailed
by purple sails; that Kallippidês, one of the most distinguished
actors of the day, performed the functions of keleustês, pronouncing
the chant or word of command to the rowers; that Chrysogonus, a
flute-player, who had gained the first prize at the Pythian games,
was also on board playing the air of return.<a id="FNanchor_214"
href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> All these details,
invented with melancholy facility, to illustrate an ideal of
ostentation and insolence, are refuted by the more simple and
credible narrative of Xenophon. The reëntry of Alkibiadês was not
merely unostentatious, but even mistrustful and apprehensive. He
had with him only twenty triremes; and though encouraged, not
merely by the assurances of his friends, but also by the news that
he had just been reëlected general, he was, nevertheless, half
afraid to disembark, even at the instant when he made fast his
ship to the quay in Peiræus. A vast crowd had assembled there from
the city and the port, animated by curiosity, interest, and other
emotions of every kind, to see him arrive. But so little did he
trust their sentiments that he hesitated at first to step on shore,
and stood upon the deck looking about for his friends and kinsmen.
Presently, he saw Euryptolemus his cousin, and others, by whom he
was heartily welcomed, and in the midst of whom he landed. But they
too were so apprehensive of his numerous enemies, that they formed
themselves into a sort of body-guard, to sur<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span>round and protect him against any
possible assault during his march from Peiræus to Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>No protection, however, was required. Not merely did his enemies
attempt no violence against him, but they said nothing in opposition
when he made his defence before the senate and the public assembly.
Protesting before the one as well as the other, his innocence of the
impiety laid to his charge, he denounced bitterly the injustice of
his enemies, and gently, but pathetically, deplored the unkindness
of the people. His friends all spoke warmly in the same strain. So
strenuous, and so pronounced, was the sentiment in his favor, both of
the senate and of the public assembly, that no one dared to address
them in the contrary sense.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216"
class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The sentence of condemnation passed
against him was cancelled: the Eumolpidæ were directed to revoke
the curse which they had pronounced upon his head: the record of
the sentence was destroyed, and the plate of lead upon which the
curse was engraven, thrown into the sea: his confiscated property
was restored: lastly, he was proclaimed general with full powers,
and allowed to prepare an expedition of one hundred triremes,
fifteen hundred hoplites from the regular muster-roll, and one
hundred and fifty horsemen. All this passed, by unopposed vote,
amidst silence on the part of enemies and acclamations from friends,
amidst unmeasured promises of future achievement from himself, and
confident assurances, impressed by his friends on willing hearers,
that Alkibiadês was the only man competent to restore the empire and
grandeur of Athens. The general expectation, which he and his friends
took every possible pains to excite, was, that his victorious career
of the last three years was a preparation for yet greater triumphs
during the next.</p>

<p>We may be satisfied, when we advert to the apprehensions of
Alkibiadês on entering the Peiræus, and to the body-guard organized
by his friends, that this overwhelming and uncontradicted<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> triumph greatly
surpassed the anticipations of both. It intoxicated him, and led
him to make light of enemies whom only just before he had so much
dreaded. This mistake, together with the carelessness and insolence
arising out of what seemed to be an unbounded ascendency, proved
the cause of his future ruin. But the truth is, that these enemies,
however they might remain silent, had not ceased to be formidable.
Alkibiadês had now been eight years in exile, from about August 415
<small>B.C.</small> to May 407 <small>B.C.</small> Now absence was
in many ways a good thing for his reputation, since his overbearing
private demeanor had been kept out of sight, and his impieties
partially forgotten. There was even a disposition among the majority
to accept his own explicit denial of the fact laid to his charge,
and to dwell chiefly upon the unworthy manœuvres of his enemies
in resisting his demand for instant trial immediately after the
accusation was broached, in order that they might calumniate him
during his absence. He was characterized as a patriot animated by
the noblest motives, who had brought both first-rate endowments and
large private wealth to the service of the commonwealth, but had been
ruined by a conspiracy of corrupt and worthless speakers, every way
inferior to him; men, whose only chance of success with the people
arose from expelling those who were better than themselves, while he,
Alkibiadês, far from having any interest adverse to the democracy,
was the natural and worthy favorite of a democratical people.<a
id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
So far as the old causes of unpopularity were concerned, therefore,
time and absence had done much to weaken their effect, and to assist
his friends in countervailing them by pointing to the treacherous
political manœuvres employed against him.</p>

<p>But if the old causes of unpopularity had thus, comparatively
speaking, passed out of sight, others had since arisen, of a graver
and more ineffaceable character. His vindictive hostility to his
country had been not merely ostentatiously proclaimed, but actively
manifested, by stabs but too effectively aimed at her vitals. The
sending of Gylippus to Syracuse, the fortification of Dekeleia,
the revolts of Chios and Milêtus, the first origination of the
conspiracy of the Four Hundred, had all been emphatically the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> measures of Alkibiadês.
Even for these, the enthusiasm of the moment attempted some excuse:
it was affirmed that he had never ceased to love his country, in
spite of her wrongs towards him, and that he had been compelled
by the necessities of exile to serve men whom he detested, at the
daily risk of his life.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a> But such pretences could not really impose
upon any one. The treason of Alkibiadês during the period of his
exile remained indefensible as well as undeniable, and would have
been more than sufficient as a theme for his enemies, had their
tongues been free. But his position was one altogether singular:
having first inflicted on his country immense mischief, he had since
rendered her valuable service, and promised to render still more.
It is true, that the subsequent service was by no means adequate to
the previous mischief: nor had it indeed been rendered exclusively
by him, since the victories of Abydos and Kyzikus belong not less to
Theramenês and Thrasybulus than to Alkibiadês:<a id="FNanchor_219"
href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> moreover, the
peculiar present or capital which he had promised to bring with
him,—Persian alliance and pay to Athens,—had proved a complete
delusion. Still, the Athenian arms had been eminently successful
since his junction, and we may see that not merely common report, but
even good judges, such as Thucydidês, ascribed this result to his
superior energy and management.</p>

<p>Without touching upon these particulars, it is impossible fully to
comprehend the very peculiar position of this returning exile before
the Athenian people in the summer of 407 <small>B.C.</small> The
more distant past exhibited him as among the worst of criminals; the
recent past, as a valuable servant and patriot: the future promised
continuance in this last character, so far as there were any positive
indications to judge by. Now this was a case in which discussion and
recrimination could not possibly answer any useful purpose. There was
every reason for reappointing Alkibiadês to his command; but this
could only be done under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p.
149]</span> prohibition of censure on his past crimes, and
provisional acceptance of his subsequent good deeds, as justifying
the hope of yet better deeds to come. The popular instinct felt this
situation perfectly, and imposed absolute silence on his enemies.<a
id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
We are not to infer from hence that the people had forgotten the
past deeds of Alkibiadês, or that they entertained for him nothing
but unqualified confidence and admiration. In their present very
justifiable sentiment of hopefulness, they determined that he should
have full scope for prosecuting his new and better career, if he
chose; and that his enemies should be precluded from reviving the
mention of an irreparable past, so as to shut the door against him.
But what was thus interdicted to men’s lips as unseasonable, was
not effaced from their recollections; nor were the enemies, though
silenced for the moment, rendered powerless for the future. All
this train of combustible matter lay quiescent, ready to be fired
by any future misconduct or negligence, perhaps even by blameless
ill-success, on the part of Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>At a juncture when so much depended upon his future behavior, he
showed, as we shall see presently, that he completely misinterpreted
the temper of the people. Intoxicated by the unexpected triumph of
his reception, according to that fatal susceptibility so common among
distinguished Greeks, he forgot his own past history, and fancied
that the people had forgotten and forgiven it also; construing
their studied and well-advised silence into a proof of oblivion.
He conceived himself in assured possession of public confidence,
and looked upon his numerous enemies as if they no longer existed,
because they were not allowed to speak at a most unseasonable hour.
Without doubt, his exultation was shared by his friends, and this
sense of false security proved his future ruin.</p>

<p>Two colleagues, recommended by Alkibiadês himself, Adeimantus and
Aristokratês, were named by the people as generals of the hoplites to
go out with him, in case of operations ashore.<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> In less than three months, his
armament was ready; but he designedly deferred his departure until
that day of the month Boedromion, about the beginning of September,
when the Eleusinian mysteries were celebrated, and when the solemn
processional march of the crowd of communicants was wont to take
place, along the Sacred Way from Athens to Eleusis. For seven
successive years, ever since the establishment of Agis at Dekeleia,
this march had been of necessity discontinued, and the procession had
been transported by sea, to the omission of many of the ceremonial
details. Alkibiadês, on this occasion, caused the land-march to be
renewed, in full pomp and solemnity; assembling all his troops in
arms to protect, in case any attack should be made from Dekeleia.
No such attack was hazarded; so that he had the satisfaction of
reviving the full regularity of this illustrious scene, and escorting
the numerous communicants out and home, without the smallest
interruption; an exploit gratifying to the religious feelings of
the people, and imparting an acceptable sense of undiminished
Athenian power; while in reference to his own reputation, it was
especially politic, as serving to make his peace with the Eumolpidæ
and the Two Goddesses, on whose account he had been condemned.<a
id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the mysteries, he departed with his armament.
It appears that Agis at Dekeleia, though he had not chosen to come
out and attack Alkibiadês when posted to guard the Eleusinian
procession, had nevertheless felt humiliated by the defiance offered
to him. He shortly afterwards took advantage of the departure of this
large force, to summon reinforcements from Peloponnesus and Bœotia,
and attempt to surprise the walls of Athens on a dark night. If he
expected any connivance within, the plot miscarried: alarm was given
in time, and the eldest and youngest hoplites were found at their
posts to defend the walls. The assailants—said to have amounted
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> twenty-eight
thousand men, of whom half were hoplites, with twelve hundred
cavalry, nine hundred of them Bœotians—were seen on the ensuing day
close under the walls of the city, which were amply manned with the
full remaining strength of Athens. In an obstinate cavalry battle
which ensued, the Athenians gained the advantage even over the
Bœotians. Agis encamped the next night in the garden of Akadêmus;
again on the morrow he drew up his troops and offered battle to the
Athenians, who are affirmed to have gone forth in order of battle,
but to have kept under the protection of the missiles from the
walls, so that Agis did not dare to attack them.<a id="FNanchor_223"
href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> We may well doubt
whether the Athenians went out at all, since they had been for years
accustomed to regard themselves as inferior to the Peloponnesians
in the field. Agis now withdrew, satisfied apparently with having
offered battle, so as to efface the affront which he had received
from the march of the Eleusinian communicants in defiance of his
neighborhood.</p>

<p>The first exploit of Alkibiadês was to proceed to Andros, now
under a Lacedæmonian harmost and garrison. Landing on the island,
he plundered the fields, defeated both the native troops and the
Lacedæmonians, and forced them to shut themselves up within the
town; which he besieged for some days without avail, and then
proceeded onward to Samos, leaving Konon in a fortified post,
with twenty ships, to prosecute the siege.<a id="FNanchor_224"
href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> At Samos, he first
ascertained the state of the Peloponnesian fleet at Ephesus, the
influence acquired by Lysander over Cyrus, the strong anti-Athenian
dispositions of the young prince, and the ample rate of pay, put
down even in advance, of which the Peloponnesian seamen were now
in actual receipt. He now first became convinced of the failure of
those hopes which he had conceived, not without good reason, in the
preceding year,—and of which he had doubtless boasted at Athens,—that
the alliance of Persia might be neutralized at least, if not won
over, through the envoys escorted to Susa by Pharnabazus. It was in
vain that he prevailed upon Tissaphernês to mediate with Cyrus, to
introduce to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span> him
some Athenian envoys, and to inculcate upon him his own views of the
true interests of Persia; that is, that the war should be fed and
protracted so as to wear out both the Grecian belligerent parties,
each by means of the other. Such a policy, uncongenial at all times
to the vehement temper of Cyrus, had become yet more repugnant to
him since his intercourse with Lysander. He would not consent even
to see the envoys, nor was he probably displeased to put a slight
upon a neighbor and rival satrap. Deep was the despondency among the
Athenians at Samos, when painfully convinced that all hopes from
Persia must be abandoned for themselves; and farther, that Persian
pay was both more ample and better assured, to their enemies, than
ever it had been before.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>Lysander had at Ephesus a fleet of ninety triremes, which he
employed himself in repairing and augmenting, being still inferior in
number to the Athenians. In vain did Alkibiadês attempt to provoke
him out to a general action. This was much to the interest of the
Athenians, apart from their superiority of number, since they were
badly provided with money, and obliged to levy contributions wherever
they could: but Lysander was resolved not to fight unless he could do
so with advantage, and Cyrus, not afraid of sustaining the protracted
expense of the war, had even enjoined upon him this cautious policy,
with additional hopes of a Phenician fleet to his aid, which in his
mouth was not intended to delude, as it had been by Tissaphernês.<a
id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
Unable to bring about a general battle, and having no immediate or
capital enterprise to constrain his attention, Alkibiadês became
careless, and abandoned himself partly to the love of pleasure,
partly to reckless predatory enterprises for the purpose of getting
money to pay his army. Thrasybulus had come from his post on the
Hellespont, and was now engaged in fortifying Phokæa, probably for
the purpose of establishing a post, to be enabled to pillage the
interior. Here he was joined by Alkibiadês, who sailed across with
a squadron, leaving his main fleet at Samos. He left it under the
com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span>mand of his
favorite pilot Antiochus, but with express orders on no account to
fight until his return.</p>

<p>While employed in this visit to Phokæa and Klazomenæ, Alkibiadês,
perhaps hard-pressed for money, conceived the unwarrantable project
of enriching his men by the plunder of the neighboring territory
of Kymê, an allied dependency of Athens. Landing on this territory
unexpectedly, after fabricating some frivolous calumnies against the
Kymæans, he at first seized much property and a considerable number
of prisoners. But the inhabitants assembled in arms, bravely defended
their possessions, and repelled his men to their ships; recovering
the plundered property, and lodging it in safety within their walls.
Stung with this miscarriage, Alkibiadês sent for a reinforcement of
hoplites from Mitylênê, and marched up to the walls of Kymê, where
he in vain challenged the citizens to come forth and fight. He then
ravaged the territory at pleasure: nor had the Kymæans any other
resource, except to send envoys to Athens, to complain of so gross
an outrage, inflicted by the Athenian general upon an unoffending
Athenian dependency.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227"
class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>This was a grave charge, nor was it the only charge which
Alkibiadês had to meet at Athens. During his absence at Phokæa and
Kymê, Antiochus the pilot, whom he had left in command, disobeying
the express order pronounced against fighting a battle, first sailed
across from Samos to Notium, the harbor of Kolophon, and from thence
to the mouth of the harbor of Ephesus, where the Peloponnesian fleet
lay. Entering that harbor with his own ship and another, he passed
close in front of the prows of the Peloponnesian triremes, insulting
them scornfully and defying them to combat. Lysander detached some
ships to pursue him, and an action gradually ensued, which was
exactly that which Antiochus desired. But the Athenian ships were
all in disorder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>
and came into battle as each of them separately could; while the
Peloponnesian fleet was well marshalled and kept in hand; so that
the battle was all to the advantage of the latter. The Athenians,
compelled to take flight, were pursued to Notium, losing fifteen
triremes, several along with their full crews. Antiochus himself was
slain. Before retiring to Ephesus, Lysander had the satisfaction
of erecting his trophy on the shore of Notium; while the Athenian
fleet was carried back to its station at Samos.<a id="FNanchor_228"
href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>It was in vain that Alkibiadês, hastening back to Samos, mustered
the entire Athenian fleet, sailed to the mouth of the harbor of
Ephesus, and there ranged his ships in battle order, challenging
the enemy to come forth. Lysander would give him no opportunity of
wiping out the late dishonor. And as an additional mortification
to Athens, the Lacedæmonians shortly afterwards captured both
Teos and Delphinium; the latter being a fortified post which the
Athenians had held for the last three years in the island of Chios.<a
id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Even before the battle of Notium, it appears that complaints
and dissatisfactions had been growing up in the armament against
Alkibiadês. He had gone out with a splendid force, not inferior,
in number of triremes and hoplites, to that which he had conducted
against Sicily, and under large promises, both from himself and his
friends, of achievements to come. Yet in a space of time which can
hardly have been less than three months, not a single success had
been accomplished; while on the other side there was to be reckoned
the disappointment on the score of Persia, which had great effect
on the temper of the armament, and which, though not his fault, was
contrary to expectations which he had held out, the disgraceful
plunder of Kymê, and the defeat at Notium. It was true that
Alkibiadês had given peremptory orders to Antiochus not to fight, and
that the battle had been hazarded in flagrant disobedience to his
injunctions. But this cir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p.
155]</span>cumstance only raised new matter for dissatisfaction
of a graver character. If Antiochus had been disobedient,—if,
besides disobedience, he had displayed a childish vanity and an
utter neglect of all military precautions,—who was it that had
chosen him for deputy; and that too against all Athenian precedent,
putting the pilot, a paid officer of the ship, over the heads of the
trierarchs who paid their pilots, and served at their own cost? It
was Alkibiadês who placed Antiochus in this grave and responsible
situation,—a personal favorite, an excellent convivial companion, but
destitute of all qualities befitting a commander. And this turned
attention on another point of the character of Alkibiadês, his habits
of excessive self-indulgence and dissipation. The loud murmurs of the
camp charged him with neglecting the interests of the service for
enjoyments with jovial parties and Ionian women, and with admitting
to his confidence those who best contributed to the amusement
of these chosen hours.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>It was in the camp at Samos that this general indignation
against Alkibiadês first arose, and was from thence transmitted
formally to Athens, by the mouth of Thrasybulus son of Thrason,<a
id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
not the eminent Thrasybulus, son of Lykus, who has been already
often spoken of in this history, and will be so again. There came
at the same time to Athens the complaints from Kymê, against the
unprovoked aggression and plunder of that place by Alkibiadês; and
seemingly complaints from other places besides.<a id="FNanchor_232"
href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> It was even
urged as accusation against him, that he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> was in guilty collusion to betray the
fleet to Pharnabazus and the Lacedæmonians, and that he had already
provided three strong forts in the Chersonese to retire to, as soon
as this scheme should be ripe for execution.</p>

<p>Such grave and wide-spread accusations, coupled with the disaster
at Notium, and the complete disappointment of all the promises of
success, were more than sufficient to alter the sentiments of the
people of Athens towards Alkibiadês. He had no character to fall
back upon; or rather, he had a character worse than none, such as to
render the most criminal imputations of treason not intrinsically
improbable. The comments of his enemies, which had been forcibly
excluded from public discussion during his summer visit to Athens,
were now again set free; and all the adverse recollections of his
past life doubtless revived. The people had refused to listen to
these, in order that he might have a fair trial, and might verify
the title, claimed for him by his friends, to be judged only by his
subsequent exploits, achieved since the year 411 <small>B.C.</small>
He had now had his trial; he had been found wanting; and the popular
confidence, which had been provisionally granted to him, was
accordingly withdrawn.</p>

<p>It is not just to represent the Athenian people, however Plutarch
and Cornelius Nepos may set before us this picture, as having
indulged an extravagant and unmeasured confidence in Alkibiadês in
the month of July, demanding of him more than man could perform,
and as afterwards in the month of December passing, with childish
abruptness, from confidence into wrathful displeasure, because their
own impossible expectations were not already realized. That the
people entertained large expectations, from so very considerable
an armament, cannot be doubted: the largest of all, probably, as
in the instance of the Sicilian expedition, were those entertained
by Alkibiadês himself, and promulgated by his friends. But we are
not called upon to determine what the people would have done, had
Alkibiadês, after per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span>forming all the duties of a faithful, skilful, and
enterprising commander, nevertheless failed, from obstacles beyond
his own control, in realizing their hopes and his own promises. No
such case occurred: that which did occur was materially different.
Besides the absence of grand successes, he had farther been negligent
and reckless in his primary duties; he had exposed the Athenian arms
to defeat, by his disgraceful selection of an unworthy lieutenant;<a
id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> he
had violated the territory and property of an allied dependency, at a
moment when Athens had a paramount interest in cultivating by every
means the attachment of her remaining allies. The truth is, as I have
before remarked, that he had really been spoiled by the intoxicating
reception given to him so unexpectedly in the city. He had mistaken
a hopeful public, determined, even by forced silence as to the past,
to give him the full benefit of a meritorious future, but requiring
as condition from him, that that future should really be meritorious,
for a public of assured admirers, whose favor he had already earned
and might consider as his own. He became an altered man after that
visit, like Miltiadês after the battle of Marathon; or, rather, the
impulses of a character essentially dissolute and insolent, broke
loose from that restraint under which they had before been partially
controlled. At the time of the battle of Kyzikus, when Alkibiadês
was laboring to regain the favor of his injured countrymen,
and was yet uncertain whether he should<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> succeed, he would not have committed
the fault of quitting his fleet and leaving it under the command
of a lieutenant like Antiochus. If, therefore, Athenian sentiment
towards Alkibiadês underwent an entire change during the autumn of
407 <small>B.C.</small>, this was in consequence of an alteration in
<i>his</i> character and behavior; an alteration for the worse, just at
the crisis when everything turned upon his good conduct, and upon his
deserving at least, if he could not command success.</p>

<p>We may, indeed, observe that the faults of Nikias before Syracuse,
and in reference to the coming of Gylippus, were far graver and more
mischievous than those of Alkibiadês during this turning season of
his career, and the disappointment of antecedent hopes at least
equal. Yet while these faults and disappointment brought about
the dismissal and disgrace of Alkibiadês, they did not induce the
Athenians to dismiss Nikias, though himself desiring it, nor even
prevent them from sending him a second armament to be ruined along
with the first. The contrast is most instructive, as demonstrating
upon what points durable esteem in Athens turned; how long the
most melancholy public incompetency could remain overlooked, when
covered by piety, decorum, good intentions, and high station;<a
id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
how short-lived was the ascendency of a man far superior in ability
and energy, besides an equal station, when his moral qualities
and antecedent life were such as to provoke fear and hatred in
many, esteem from none. Yet, on the whole, Nikias, looking at him
as a public servant, was far more destructive to his country than
Alkibiadês. The mischief done to Athens by the latter was done in the
avowed service of her enemies.</p>

<p>On hearing the news of the defeat of Notium and the accumulated
complaints against Alkibiadês, the Athenians simply voted that he
should be dismissed from his command; naming<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> ten new generals to replace him. He
was not brought to trial, nor do we know whether any such step was
proposed. Yet his proceedings at Kymê, if they happened as we read
them, richly deserved judicial animadversion; and the people, had
they so dealt with him, would only have acted up to the estimable
function ascribed to them by the oligarchical Phrynichus, “of serving
as refuge to their dependent allies, and chastising the high-handed
oppressions of the optimates against them.”<a id="FNanchor_235"
href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In the perilous
position of Athens, however, with reference to the foreign war, such
a political trial would have been productive of much dissension
and mischief. And Alkibiadês avoided the question by not coming to
Athens. As soon as he heard of his dismissal, he retired immediately
from the army to his own fortified posts on the Chersonese.</p>

<p>The ten new generals named were Konon, Diomedon, Leon, Periklês,
Erasinidês, Aristokratês, Archestratus, Protomachus, Thrasyllus,
Aristogenês. Of these, Konon was directed to proceed forthwith from
Andros with the twenty ships which he had there, to receive the fleet
from Alkibiadês; while Phanosthenês proceeded with four triremes to
replace Konon at Andros.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236"
class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>In his way thither, Phanosthenês fell in with Dorieus the Rhodian
and two Thurian triremes, which he captured, with every man aboard.
The captives were sent to Athens, where all were placed in custody,
in case of future exchange, except Dorieus himself. The latter
had been condemned to death, and banished from his native city of
Rhodes, together with his kindred, probably on the score of political
disaffection, at the time when Rhodes was a member of the Athenian
alliance. Having since then become a citizen of Thurii, he had served
with distinction in the fleet of Mindarus, both at Milêtus and the
Hellespont. The Athenians now had so much compassion upon him that
they released him at once and unconditionally, without even demanding
a ransom or an equivalent. By what particular circumstance their
compassion was determined, forming a pleasing<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> exception to the melancholy habits
which pervaded Grecian warfare in both belligerents, we should never
have learned from the meagre narrative of Xenophon. But we ascertain
from other sources, that Dorieus, the son of Diagoras of Rhodes,
was illustrious beyond all other Greeks for his victories in the
pankration at the Olympic, Isthmian, and Nemean festivals; that he
had gained the first prize at three Olympic festivals in succession,
of which Olympiad 88, or 428 <small>B.C.</small> was
the second, a distinction altogether without precedent, besides
eight Isthmian and seven Nemean prizes; that his father Diagoras,
his brothers, and his cousins, were all celebrated as successful
athletes; lastly, that the family were illustrious from old date
in their native island of Rhodes, and were even descended from the
Messenian hero Aristomenês. When the Athenians saw before them as
their prisoner a man doubtless of magnificent stature and presence,
as we may conclude from his athletic success, and surrounded by
such a halo of glory, impressive in the highest degree to Grecian
imagination, the feelings and usages of war were at once overruled.
Though Dorieus had been one of their most vehement enemies, they
could not bear either to touch his person, or to exact from him any
condition. Released by them on this occasion, he lived to be put
to death, about thirteen years afterwards, by the Lacedæmonians.<a
id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>When Konon reached Samos to take the command, he found the
armament in a state of great despondency; not merely from the
dishonorable affair of Notium, but also from disappointed hopes
connected with Alkibiadês, and from difficulties in procuring
regular pay. So painfully was the last inconvenience felt, that the
first measure of Konon was to contract the numbers of the armament
from above one hundred triremes to seventy; and to reserve for the
diminished fleet all the ablest seamen of the larger. With this
fleet, he and his colleagues roved about the enemies’ coasts to
collect plunder and pay.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"
class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Apparently about the same time that Konon superseded Alkibiadês,
that is, about December 407 <small>B.C.</small> or
January 406 <small>B.C.</small>, the year of Lysander’s
command expired, and Kallikratidas arrived<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span> from Sparta to replace him. His
arrival was received with undisguised dissatisfaction by the leading
Lacedæmonians in the armament, by the chiefs in the Asiatic cities,
and by Cyrus. Now was felt the full influence of those factious
correspondences and intrigues which Lysander had established with
all of them, for indirectly working out the perpetuity of his own
command. While loud complaints were heard of the impolicy of Sparta,
in annually changing her admiral, both Cyrus and the rest concurred
with Lysander in throwing difficulties in the way of the new
successor.</p>

<p>Kallikratidas, unfortunately only shown by the Fates,<a
id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
and not suffered to continue in the Grecian world, was one of the
noblest characters of his age. Besides perfect courage, energy, and
incorruptibility, he was distinguished for two qualities, both of
them very rare among eminent Greeks; entire straightforwardness of
dealing, and a Pan-Hellenic patriotism alike comprehensive, exalted,
and merciful. Lysander handed over to him nothing but an empty purse;
having repaid to Cyrus all the money remaining in his possession,
under pretence that it had been confided to himself personally.<a
id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
Moreover, on delivering up the fleet to Kallikratidas at Ephesus,
he made boast of delivering to him at the same time the mastery of
the sea, through the victory recently gained at Notium. “Conduct the
fleet from Ephesus along the coast of Samos, passing by the Athenian
station (replied Kallikratidas), and give it up to me at Milêtus: I
shall then believe in your mastery of the sea.” Lysander had nothing
else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> to say,
except that he should give himself no farther trouble, now that his
command had been transferred to another.</p>

<p>Kallikratidas soon found that the leading Lacedæmonians in the
fleet, gained over to the interests of his predecessor, openly
murmured at his arrival, and secretly obstructed all his measures;
upon which he summoned them together, and said: “I, for my part, am
quite content to remain at home; and if Lysander, or any one else,
pretends to be a better admiral than I am, I have nothing to say
against it. But sent here as I am by the authorities at Sparta to
command the fleet, I have no choice except to execute their orders in
the best way that I can. You now know how far my ambition reaches;<a
id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
you know also the murmurs which are abroad against our common city
(for her frequent change of admirals). Look to it, and give me your
opinion. Shall I stay where I am, or shall I go home, and communicate
what has happened here?”</p>

<p>This remonstrance, alike pointed and dignified, produced its
full effect. Every one replied, that it was his duty to stay and
undertake the command. The murmurs and cabals were from that moment
discontinued.</p>

<p>His next embarrassments arose from the manœuvre of Lysander in
paying back to Cyrus all the funds from whence the continuous pay of
the army was derived. Of course this step was admirably calculated to
make every one regret the alteration of command. Kallikratidas, who
had been sent out without funds, in full reliance on the unexhausted
supply from Sardis, now found himself compelled to go thither in
person and solicit a renewal of the bounty. But Cyrus, eager to
manifest in every way his partiality for the last admiral, deferred
receiving him, first for two days, then for a farther interval, until
the patience of Kallikratidas was wearied out, so that he left Sardis
in disgust without an interview. So intolerable to his feelings
was the humiliation of thus begging at the palace gates, that he
bitterly deplored those miserable dissensions among the Greeks which
constrained both parties to truckle to the foreigner for money;
swearing that, if he survived the year’s campaign, he would use<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span> every possible effort
to bring about an accommodation between Athens and Sparta.<a
id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>In the mean time, he put forth all his energy to obtain money in
some other way, and thus get the fleet to sea; knowing well, that the
way to overcome the reluctance of Cyrus was, to show that he could
do without him. Sailing first from Ephesus to Milêtus, he despatched
from thence a small squadron to Sparta, disclosing his unexpected
poverty, and asking for speedy pecuniary aid. In the mean time he
convoked an assembly of the Milesians, communicated to them the
mission just sent to Sparta, and asked from them a temporary supply
until this money should arrive. He reminded them that the necessity
of this demand sprang altogether from the manœuvre of Lysander, in
paying back the funds in his hands; that he had already in vain
applied to Cyrus for farther money, meeting only with such insulting
neglect as could no longer be endured: that they, the Milesians,
dwelling amidst the Persians, and having already experienced the
maximum of ill-usage at their hands, ought now to be foremost in
the war, and to set an example of zeal to the other allies,<a
id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> in
order to get clear the sooner from dependence upon such imperious
taskmasters. He promised that, when the remittance from Sparta and
the hour of success should arrive, he would richly requite their
forwardness. “Let us, with the aid of the gods, show these foreigners
(he concluded) that we can punish our enemies without worshipping
them.”</p>

<p>The spectacle of this generous patriot, struggling against a
degrading dependence on the foreigner, which was now becoming
unhappily familiar to the leading Greeks of both sides, excites
our warm sympathy and admiration. We may add, that his language to
the Milesians, reminding them of the misery which they had endured
from the Persians as a motive to exertion in the war, is full of
instruction as to the new situation opened for the Asiatic Greeks
since the breaking-up of the Athenian power. No such evils had they
suffered while Athens was com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[p.
164]</span>petent to protect them, and while they were willing to
receive protection from her, during the interval of more than fifty
years between the complete organization of the confederacy of Delos
and the disaster of Nikias before Syracuse.</p>

<p>The single-hearted energy of Kallikratidas imposed upon all
who heard him, and even inspired so much alarm to those leading
Milesians who were playing underhand the game of Lysander, that they
were the first to propose a large grant of money towards the war,
and to offer considerable sums from their own purses; an example
probably soon followed by other allied cities. Some of the friends
of Lysander tried to couple their offers with conditions; demanding
a warrant for the destruction of their political enemies, and hoping
thus to compromise the new admiral. But he strenuously refused all
such guilty compliances.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244"
class="fnanchor">[244]</a> He was soon able to collect at Milêtus
fifty fresh triremes in addition to those left by Lysander, making
a fleet of one hundred and forty sail in all. The Chians having
furnished him with an outfit of five drachmas for each seaman,
equal to ten days’ pay at the usual rate, he sailed with the
whole fleet northward towards Lesbos. Of this numerous fleet, the
greatest which had yet been assembled throughout the war, only ten
triremes were Lacedæmonian;<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
class="fnanchor">[245]</a> while a considerable proportion, and among
the best equipped, were Bœotian and Eubœan.<a id="FNanchor_246"
href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In his voyage
towards Lesbos, Kallikratidas seems to have made himself master
of Phokæa and Kymê,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247"
class="fnanchor">[247]</a> perhaps with the greater facility in
consequence of the recent ill-treatment of the Kymæans by Alkibiadês.
He then sailed to attack Methymna, on the northern coast of Lesbos;
a town not only strongly attached to the Athenians, but also
defended by an Athenian garrison. Though at first repulsed, he
renewed his attacks until at length he took the town by storm. The
property in it was all plundered by the soldiers, and the slaves
collected and sold for their benefit. It was farther demanded by the
allies, and expected pursuant to ordinary cus<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>tom, that the Methymnæan and Athenian
prisoners should be sold also. But Kallikratidas peremptorily
refused compliance, and set them all free the next day; declaring
that, so long as he was in command, not a single free Greek should
be reduced to slavery if he could prevent it.<a id="FNanchor_248"
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>No one, who has not familiarized himself with the details of
Grecian warfare, can feel the full grandeur and sublimity of this
proceeding, which stands, so far as I know, unparalleled in Grecian
history. It is not merely that the prisoners were spared and set
free; as to this point, analogous cases may be found, though not
very frequent. It is, that this particular act of generosity was
performed in the name and for the recommendation of Pan-Hellenic
brotherhood and Pan-Hellenic independence of the foreigner: a
comprehensive principle, announced by Kallikratidas on previous
occasions as well as on this, but now carried into practice under
emphatic circumstances, and coupled with an explicit declaration of
his resolution to abide by it in all future cases. It is, lastly,
that the step was taken in resistance to formal requisition on the
part of his allies, whom he had very imperfect means either of paying
or controlling, and whom therefore it was so much the more hazardous
for him to offend. There cannot be any doubt that these allies felt
personally wronged and indignant at the loss, as well as confounded
with the proposition of a rule of duty so new, as respected the
relations of belligerents in Greece; against which too, let us add,
their murmurs would not be without some foundation: “If <i>we</i> should
come to be Konon’s prisoners, he will not treat <i>us</i> in this manner.”
Reciprocity of dealing is absolutely essential to constant moral
observance, either public or private; and doubtless Kallikratidas
felt a well-grounded confidence, that two or three conspicuous
examples would sensibly modify the future practice on both sides. But
some one must begin by setting such examples, and the man who does
begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span>—having a
position which gives reasonable chance that others will follow—is the
hero. An admiral like Lysander would not only sympathize heartily
with the complaints of the allies, but also condemn the proceeding
as a dereliction of duty to Sparta; even men better than Lysander
would at first look coldly on it as a sort of Quixotism, in doubt
whether the example would be copied: while the Spartan ephors,
though probably tolerating it because they interfered very sparingly
with their admirals afloat, would certainly have little sympathy
with the feelings in which it originated. So much the rather is
Kallikratidas to be admired, as bringing out with him not only a
Pan-Hellenic patriotism,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"
class="fnanchor">[249]</a> rare either at Athens or Sparta, but also
a force of individual character and conscience yet rarer, enabling
him to brave unpopularity and break through routine, in the attempt
to make that patriotism fruitful and operative in practice. In his
career, so sadly and prematurely closed, there was at least this
circumstance to be envied; that the capture of Methymna afforded
him the opportunity, which he greedily seized, as if he had known
that it would be the last, of putting in act and evidence the full
aspirations of his magnanimous soul.</p>

<p>Kallikratidas sent word by the released prisoners to Konon,
that he would presently put an end to his adulterous intercourse
with the sea;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250"
class="fnanchor">[250]</a> which he now considered as his wife, and
lawfully appertaining to him, having one hundred and forty triremes
against the seventy triremes of Konon. That admiral, in spite of
his inferior numbers, had advanced near to Methymna, to try and
relieve it; but finding the place already captured, had retired to
the islands called Hekatonnêsoi, off the continent bearing northeast
from Lesbos. Thither he was followed by Kallikratidas, who, leaving
Methymna at night, found him quitting his moorings at break of
day, and immediately made all sail to try and cut him off from the
southerly course towards Samos. But Konon,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span> having diminished the number of his
triremes from one hundred to seventy, had been able to preserve
all the best rowers, so that in speed he outran Kallikratidas and
entered first the harbor of Mitylênê. His pursuers, however, were
close behind, and even got into the harbor along with him, before it
could be closed and put in a state of defence. Constrained to fight
a battle at its entrance, he was completely defeated; thirty of his
ships were taken, though the crews escaped to land; and he preserved
the remaining forty only by hauling them ashore under the wall.<a
id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>The town of Mitylênê, originally founded on a small islet off
Lesbos, had afterwards extended across a narrow strait to Lesbos
itself. By this strait, whether bridged over or not we are not
informed, the town was divided into two portions, and had two
harbors, one opening northward towards the Hellespont, the other
southward towards the promontory of Kanê on the mainland.<a
id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
Both these harbors were undefended, and both now fell into the
occupation of the Peloponnesian fleet; at least all the outer portion
of each, near to the exit of the harbor, which Kallikrati<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span>das kept under strict
watch. He at the same time sent for the full forces of Methymna and
for hoplites across from Chios, so as to block up Mitylênê by land
as well as by sea. As soon as his success was announced, too, money
for the fleet, together with separate presents for himself, which
he declined receiving,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a> was immediately sent to him by Cyrus; so
that his future operations became easy.</p>

<p>No preparations had been made at Mitylênê for a siege: no stock
of provisions had been accumulated, and the crowd within the walls
was so considerable, that Konon foresaw but too plainly the speedy
exhaustion of his means. Nor could he expect succor from Athens,
unless he could send intelligence thither of his condition; of which,
as he had not been able to do so, the Athenians remained altogether
ignorant. All his ingenuity was required to get a trireme safe out
of the harbor, in the face of the enemy’s guard. Putting afloat two
triremes, the best sailers in his fleet, and picking out the best
rowers for them out of all the rest, he caused these rowers to go
aboard before daylight, concealing the epibatæ, or maritime soldiers,
in the interior of the vessel, instead of the deck, which was their
usual place, with a moderate stock of provisions, and keeping
the vessel still covered with hides or sails, as was customary
with vessels hauled ashore, to protect them against the sun.<a
id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
These two triremes were thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p.
169]</span> made ready to depart at a moment’s notice, without
giving any indication to the enemy that they were so. They were
fully manned before daybreak, the crews remained in their position
all day, and after dark were taken out to repose. This went on for
four days successively, no favorable opportunity having occurred
to give the signal for attempting a start. At length, on the fifth
day, about noon, when many of the Peloponnesian crews were ashore
for their morning meal, and others were reposing, the moment seemed
favorable, the signal was given, and both the triremes started at the
same moment with their utmost speed; one to go out at the southern
entrance towards the sea, between Lesbos and Chios, the other to
depart by the northern entrance towards the Hellespont. Instantly,
the alarm was given among the Peloponnesian fleet: the cables were
cut, the men hastened aboard, and many triremes were put in motion
to overtake the two runaways. That which departed southward, in
spite of the most strenuous efforts, was caught towards evening and
brought back with all her crew prisoners: that which went towards the
Hellespont escaped, rounded the northern coast of Lesbos, and got
safe with the news to Athens; sending intelligence also, seemingly,
in her way, to the Athenian admiral Diomedon at Samos.</p>

<p>The latter immediately made all haste to the aid of Konon, with
the small force which he had with him, no more than twelve triremes.
The two harbors being both guarded by a superior force, he tried to
get access to Mitylênê through the Euripus, a strait which opens
on the southern coast of the island into an interior lake, or bay,
approaching near to the town. But here he was attacked suddenly by
Kallikratidas, and his squadron all captured except two triremes,
his own and another; he himself had great difficulty in escaping.<a
id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span></p> <p>Athens
was all in consternation at the news of the defeat of Konon and the
blockade of Mitylênê. The whole strength and energy of the city
was put forth to relieve him, by an effort greater than any which
had been made throughout the whole war. We read with surprise that
within the short space of thirty days, a fleet of no less than one
hundred and ten triremes was fitted out and sent from Peiræus. Every
man of age and strength to serve, without distinction, was taken to
form a good crew; not only freemen, but slaves, to whom manumission
was promised as reward: many also of the horsemen, or knights,<a
id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and
citizens of highest rank, went aboard as epibatæ, hanging up their
bridles like Kimon before the battle of Salamis. The levy was in fact
as democratical and as equalizing as it had been on that memorable
occasion. The fleet proceeded straight to Samos, whither orders
had doubtless been sent to get together all the triremes which the
allies could furnish as reinforcements, as well as all the scattered
Athenian. By this means, forty additional triremes, ten of them
Samian, were assembled, and the whole fleet, one hundred and fifty
sail, went from Samos to the little islands called Arginusæ, close on
the mainland, opposite to Malea, the southeastern cape of Lesbos.</p>

<p>Kallikratidas, apprized of the approach of the new fleet while
it was yet at Samos, withdrew the greater portion of his force from
Mitylênê, leaving fifty triremes under Eteonikus to continue the
blockade. Less than fifty probably would not have been sufficient,
inasmuch as two harbors were to be watched; but he was thus reduced
to meet the Athenian fleet with inferior numbers, one hundred and
twenty triremes against one hundred and fifty. His fleet was off
Cape Malea, where the crews took their suppers, on the same evening
as the Athenians supped at the opposite islands of Arginusæ. It
was his project to sail across the intermediate channel in the
night, and attack them in the morning before they were prepared;
but violent wind and rain forced him to defer all movement till
daylight. On the ensuing morning, both parties prepared for the
greatest naval encounter which had taken place throughout the
whole war. Kallikratidas was advised by his pilot, the Megarian
Hermon, to retire for the present without fighting, inasmuch as the
Athenian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> fleet
had the advantage of thirty triremes over him in number. He replied
that flight was disgraceful, and that Sparta would be no worse off,
even if he should perish.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257"
class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The answer was one congenial to his
chivalrous nature; and we may well conceive, that, having for
the last two or three months been lord and master of the sea, he
recollected his own haughty message to Konon, and thought it dishonor
to incur or deserve, by retiring, the like taunt upon himself. We
may remark too that the disparity of numbers, though serious, was by
no means such as to render the contest hopeless, or to serve as a
legitimate ground for retreat, to one who prided himself on a full
measure of Spartan courage.</p>

<p>The Athenian fleet was so marshalled, that its great strength
was placed in the two wings; in each of which there were sixty
Athenian ships, divided into four equal divisions, each division
commanded by a general. Of the four squadrons of fifteen ships
each, two were placed in front, two to support them in the rear.
Aristokratês and Diomedon commanded the two front squadrons of the
left division, Periklês and Erasinidês the two squadrons in the rear:
on the right division, Protomachus and Thrasyllus commanded the two
in front, Lysias and Aristogenês the two in the rear. The centre,
wherein were the Samians and other allies, was left weak, and all in
single line: it appears to have been exactly in front of one of the
isles of Arginusæ, while the two other divisions were to the right
and left of that isle. We read with some surprise that the whole
Lacedæmonian fleet was arranged by single ships, because it sailed
better and manœuvred better than the Athenians; who formed their
right and left divisions in deep order, for the express purpose of
hindering the enemy from performing the nautical manœuvres of the
diekplus and the periplus.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258"
class="fnanchor">[258]</a> It would seem that the Athenian centre,
hav<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span>ing the land
immediately in its rear, was supposed to be better protected against
an enemy “sailing through the line out to the rear, and sailing round
about,” than the other divisions, which were in the open waters; for
which reason it was left weak, with the ships in single line. But
the fact which strikes us the most is, that, if we turn back to the
beginning of the war, we shall find that this diekplus and periplus
were the special manœuvres of the Athenian navy, and continued to be
so even down to the siege of Syracuse; the Lacedæmonians being at
first absolutely unable to perform them at all, and continuing for a
long time to perform them far less skilfully than the Athenians. Now,
the comparative value of both parties is reversed: the superiority
of nautical skill has passed to the Peloponnesians and their allies:
the precautions whereby that superiority is neutralized or evaded,
are forced as a necessity on the Athenians. How astonished would the
Athenian admiral Phormion have been, if he could have witnessed the
fleets and the order of battle at Arginusæ!</p>

<p>Kallikratidas himself, with the ten Lacedæmonian ships, was on the
right of his fleet: on the left were the Bœotians and Eubœans, under
the Bœotian admiral Thrasondas. The battle was long and obstinately
contested, first by the two fleets in their original order;
afterwards, when all order was broken, by scattered ships mingled
together and contending in individual combat. At length the brave
Kallikratidas perished. His ship was in the act of driving against
the ship of an enemy, and he himself probably, like Brasidas<a
id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
at Pylos, had planted himself on the forecastle, to be the first
in boarding the enemy, or in preventing the enemy from boarding
him, when the shock arising from impact threw him off his footing,
so that he fell overboard and was drowned.<a id="FNanchor_260"
href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> In spite of the
discouragement springing from his death, the ten Lacedæmonian
triremes displayed a courage worthy of his, and nine of them
were destroyed or disa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p.
173]</span>bled. At length the Athenians were victorious in all
parts: the Peloponnesian fleet gave way, and their flight became
general, partly to Chios, partly to Phokæa. More than sixty of
their ships were destroyed over and above the nine Lacedæmonian,
seventy-seven in all; making a total loss of above the half of the
entire fleet. The loss of the Athenians was also severe, amounting to
twenty-five triremes. They returned to Arginusæ after the battle.<a
id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>The victory of Arginusæ afforded the most striking proof how much
the democratical energy of Athens could yet accomplish, in spite
of so many years of exhausting war. But far better would it have
been, if her energy on this occasion had been less efficacious and
successful. The defeat of the Peloponnesian fleet, and the death
of their admirable leader,—we must take the second as inseparable
from the first, since Kallikratidas was not the man to survive a
defeat,—were signal misfortunes to the whole Grecian world; and in
an especial manner, misfortunes to Athens herself. If Kallikratidas
had gained the victory and survived it, he would certainly have
been the man to close the Peloponnesian war; for Mitylênê must
immediately have surrendered, and Konon, with all the Athenian
fleet there blocked up, must have become his prisoners; which
circumstance, coming at the back of a defeat, would have rendered
Athens disposed to acquiesce in any tolerable terms of peace. Now to
have the terms dictated at a moment when her power was not wholly
prostrate, by a man like Kallikratidas, free from corrupt personal
ambition and of a generous Pan-Hellenic patriotism, would have
been the best fate which at this moment could befall her; while
to the Grecian world generally, it would have been an unspeakable
benefit, that, in the reorganization which it was sure to undergo
at the close of the war, the ascendant individual of the moment
should be penetrated with devotion to the great ideas of Hellenic
brotherhood at home, and Hellenic independence against the foreigner.
The near prospect of such a benefit was opened by that rare chance
which threw Kallikratidas into the command, enabled him not only
to publish his lofty profession of faith but to show that he was
prepared to act upon it, and for a time float<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>ed him on towards complete success. Nor
were the envious gods ever more envious, than when they frustrated,
by the disaster of Arginusæ, the consummation which they had thus
seemed to promise. The pertinence of these remarks will be better
understood in the <a href="#Chap_65">next chapter</a>, when I come
to recount the actual winding-up of the Peloponnesian war under the
auspices of the worthless, but able, Lysander. It was into his hands
that the command was retransferred, a transfer almost from the best
of Greeks to the worst. We shall then see how much the sufferings of
the Grecian world, and of Athens especially, were aggravated by his
individual temper and tendencies, and we shall then feel by contrast,
how much would have been gained if the commander armed with such
great power of dictation had been a Pan-Hellenic patriot. To have
the sentiment of that patriotism enforced, at a moment of break-up
and rearrangement throughout Greece, by the victorious leader of the
day, with single-hearted honesty and resolution, would have been a
stimulus to all the better feelings of the Grecian mind, such as no
other combination of circumstances could have furnished. The defeat
and death of Kallikratidas was thus even more deplorable as a loss to
Athens and Greece, than to Sparta herself. To his lofty character and
patriotism, even in so short a career, we vainly seek a parallel.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat was speedily conveyed to Eteonikus at
Mitylênê by the admiral’s signal-boat. As soon as he heard it, he
desired the crew of the signal-boat to say nothing to any one, but
to go again out of the harbor, and then return with wreaths and
shouts of triumph, crying out that Kallikratidas had gained the
victory and had destroyed or captured all the Athenian ships. All
suspicion of the reality was thus kept from Konon and the besieged,
while Eteonikus himself, affecting to believe the news, offered
the sacrifice of thanksgiving; but gave orders to all the triremes
to take their meal and depart afterwards without losing a moment,
directing the masters of the trading-ships also to put their property
silently aboard, and get off at the same time. And thus, with little
or no delay, and without the least obstruction from Konon, all
these ships, triremes and merchantmen, sailed out of the harbor and
were carried off in safety to Chios, the wind being fair. Eteonikus
at the same time withdrew his land-forces<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> to Methymna, burning his camp. Konon,
thus finding himself unexpectedly at liberty, put to sea with his
ships when the wind had become calmer, and joined the main Athenian
fleet, which he found already on its way from Arginusæ to Mitylênê.
The latter presently came to Mitylênê, and from thence passed over
to make an attack on Chios; which attack proving unsuccessful, they
went forward to their ordinary station at Samos.<a id="FNanchor_262"
href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The news of the victory at Arginusæ diffused joy and triumph at
Athens. All the slaves who had served in the armament were manumitted
and promoted, according to promise, to the rights of Platæans at
Athens, a qualified species of citizenship. Yet the joy was poisoned
by another incident, which became known at the same time, raising
sentiments of a totally opposite character, and ending in one of the
most gloomy and disgraceful proceedings in all Athenian history.</p>

<p>Not only the bodies of the slain warriors floating about on the
water had not been picked up for burial, but the wrecks had not been
visited to preserve those who were yet living. The first of these two
points, even alone, would have sufficed to excite a painful sentiment
of wounded piety at Athens. But the second point, here an essential
part of the same omission, inflamed that sentiment into shame, grief,
and indignation of the sharpest character.</p>

<p>In the descriptions of this event, Diodorus and many other
writers take notice of the first point, either exclusively,<a
id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> or
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> least with
slight reference to the second; which latter, nevertheless, stands
as far the gravest in the estimate of every impartial critic, and
was also the most violent in its effect upon Athenian feelings.
Twenty-five Athenian triremes had been ruined, along with most of
their crews; that is, lay heeled over or disabled, with their oars
destroyed, no masts, nor any means of moving; mere hulls, partially
broken by the impact of an enemy’s ship, and gradually filling and
sinking. The original crew of each was two hundred men. The field
of battle, if we may use that word for a space of sea, was strewed
with these wrecks; the men remaining on board being helpless and
unable to get away, for the ancient trireme carried no boat, nor any
aids for escape. And there were, moreover, floating about, men who
had fallen overboard, or were trying to save their lives by means
of acci<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span>dental
spars or empty casks. It was one of the privileges of a naval
victory, that the party who gained it could sail over the field
of battle, and thus assist their own helpless or wounded comrades
aboard the disabled ships,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a> taking captive, or sometimes killing,
the corresponding persons belonging to the enemy. According even
to the speech made in the Athenian public assembly afterwards, by
Euryptolemus, the defender of the accused generals, there were
twelve triremes with their crews on board lying in the condition
just described. This is an admission by the defence, and therefore
the minimum of the reality: there cannot possibly have been fewer,
but there were probably several more, out of the whole twenty-five
stated by Xenophon.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265"
class="fnanchor">[265]</a> No step being taken to preserve them,
the surviving portion, wounded as well<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> as unwounded, of these crews, were
left to be gradually drowned as each disabled ship went down. If any
of them escaped, it was by unusual goodness of swimming, by finding
some fortunate plank or spar, at any rate by the disgrace of throwing
away their arms, and by some method such as no wounded man would be
competent to employ.</p>

<p>The first letter from the generals which communicated the victory,
made known at the same time the loss sustained in obtaining it.
It announced, doubtless, the fact which we read in Xenophon, that
twenty-five Athenian triremes had been lost, with nearly all their
crews; specifying, we may be sure, the name of each trireme which
had so perished; for each trireme in the Athenian navy, like modern
ships, had its own name.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266"
class="fnanchor">[266]</a> It mentioned, at the same time, that
no step whatever had been taken by the victorious survivors to
save their wounded and drowning countrymen on board the sinking
ships. A storm had arisen, such was the reason assigned, so violent
as to render all such intervention totally impracticable.<a
id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>It is so much the custom, in dealing with Grecian history, to
presume the Athenian people to be a set of children or madmen, whose
feelings it is not worth while to try and account for, that I have
been obliged to state these circumstances somewhat at length, in
order to show that the mixed sentiment excited at Athens by the news
of the battle of Arginusæ was perfectly natural and justifiable.
Along with joy for the victory, there was blended horror and remorse
at the fact that so many of the brave men who had helped to gain
it had been left to perish unheeded. The friends and relatives
of the crews of these lost triremes were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_179">[p. 179]</span> of course foremost in the expression
of such indignant emotion. The narrative of Xenophon, meagre and
confused as well as unfair, presents this emotion as if it were
something causeless, factitious, pumped up out of the standing
irascibility of the multitude by the artifices of Theramenês,
Kallixenus, and a few others. But whatever may have been done by
these individuals to aggravate the public excitement, or pervert it
to bad purposes, assuredly the excitement itself was spontaneous,
inevitable, and amply justified. The very thought that so many of the
brave partners in the victory had been left to drown miserably on
the sinking hulls, without any effort on the part of their generals
and comrades near to rescue them, was enough to stir up all the
sensibilities, public as well as private, of the most passive nature,
even in citizens who were not related to the deceased, much more in
those who were so. To expect that the Athenians would be so absorbed
in the delight of the victory, and in gratitude to the generals who
had commanded, as to overlook such a desertion of perishing warriors,
and such an omission of sympathetic duty, is, in my judgment,
altogether preposterous; and would, if it were true, only establish
one more vice in the Athenian people, besides those which they really
had, and the many more with which they have been unjustly branded.</p>

<p>The generals, in their public letter, accounted for their
omission by saying that the violence of the storm was too great to
allow them to move. First, was this true as matter of fact? Next,
had there been time to discharge the duty, or at the least to try
and discharge it, before the storm came on to be so intolerable?
These points required examination. The generals, while honored with
a vote of thanks for the victory, were superseded, and directed
to come home; all except Konon, who having been blocked up at
Mitylênê, was not concerned in the question. Two new colleagues,
Philoklês and Adeimantus, were named to go out and join him.<a
id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
The generals probably received the notice of their re<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span>call at Samos, and
came home in consequence; reaching Athens seemingly about the end
of September or beginning of October, the battle of Arginusæ having
been fought in August 406 <small>B.C.</small> Two of the
generals, however, Protomachus and Aristogenês, declined to come:
warned of the displeasure of the people, and not confiding in their
own case to meet it, they preferred to pay the price of voluntary
exile. The other six, Periklês, Lysias, Diomedon, Erasinidês,
Aristokratês, and Thrasyllus,—Archestratus, one of the original ten,
having died at Mitylênê,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"
class="fnanchor">[269]</a>—came without their two colleagues; an
unpleasant augury for the result.</p>

<p id="Erasi">On their first arrival, Archedêmus, at that time an
acceptable popular orator, and exercising some magistracy or high
office which we cannot distinctly make out,<a id="FNanchor_270"
href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> imposed upon
Erasinidês a fine to that limited amount which was within the
competence of magistrates without the sanction of the dikastery,
and accused him besides before the dikastery; partly for general
misconduct in his command, partly on the specific charge of having
purloined some public money on its way from the Hellespont.
Erasinidês was found guilty, and condemned to be imprisoned, either
until the money was made good, or perhaps until farther examination
could take place into the other alleged misdeeds.</p>

<p>This trial of Erasinidês took place before the generals
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span> summoned
before the senate to give their formal exposition respecting the
recent battle, and the subsequent neglect of the drowning men.
And it might almost seem as if Archedêmus wished to impute to
Erasinidês exclusively, apart from the other generals, the blame of
that neglect; a distinction, as will hereafter appear, not wholly
unfounded. If, however, any such design was entertained, it did not
succeed. When the generals went to explain their case before the
senate, the decision of that body was decidedly unfavorable to all
of them, though we have no particulars of the debate which passed.
On the proposition of the senator Timokratês,<a id="FNanchor_271"
href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> a resolution was
passed that the other five generals present should be placed
in custody, as well as Erasinidês, and thus handed over to the
public assembly for consideration of the case.<a id="FNanchor_272"
href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>The public assembly was accordingly held, and the generals were
brought before it. We are here told who it was that appeared as their
principal accuser, along with several others; though unfortunately
we are left to guess what were the topics on which they insisted.
Theramenês was the man who denounced them most vehemently, as guilty
of leaving the crews of the disabled triremes to be drowned, and
of neglecting all efforts to rescue them. He appealed to their own
public letter to the people, officially communicating the victory;
in which letter they made no mention of having appointed any one to
undertake the duty, nor of having any one to blame for not performing
it. The omission, therefore, was wholly their own: they might have
performed it, and ought to be punished for so cruel a breach of
duty.</p>

<p>The generals could not have a more formidable enemy than
Theramenês. We have had occasion to follow him, during the
revolution of the Four Hundred, as a long-sighted as well as
tortuous politician: he had since been in high military command, a
partaker in victory with Alkibiadês at Kyzikus and elsewhere; and
he had served as trierarch in the victory of Arginusæ itself. His
authority therefore was naturally high, and told for much,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> when he denied the
justification which the generals had set up founded on the severity
of the storm. According to him, they might have picked up the
drowning men, and ought to have done so: either they might have
done so before the storm came on, or there never was any storm
of sufficient gravity to prevent them: upon their heads lay the
responsibility of omission.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Xenophon, in his very meagre narrative,
does not tell us, in express words, that Theramenês contradicted
the generals as to the storm. But that he did so contradict them,
point blank, is implied distinctly in that which Xenophon alleges
him to have said. It seems also that Thrasybulus—another trierarch
at Arginusæ, and a man not only of equal consequence, but of far
more estimable character—concurred with Theramenês in this same
accusation of the generals,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"
class="fnanchor">[274]</a> though not standing forward so prominently
in the case. He too therefore must have denied the reality of the
storm; or at least, the fact of its being so instant after the
battle, or so terrible as to forbid all effort for the relief of
these drowning seamen.</p>

<p>The case of the generals, as it stood before the Athenian public,
was completely altered when men like Theramenês and Thrasybulus stood
forward as their accusers. Doubtless what was said by these two had
been said by others before, in the senate and elsewhere; but it was
now publicly advanced by men of influence, as well as perfectly
cognizant of the fact. And we are thus enabled to gather indirectly,
what the narrative of Xenophon, studiously keeping back the case
against the generals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p.
183]</span> does not directly bring forward, that though the generals
affirmed the storm, there were others present who denied it, thus
putting in controversy the matter of fact which formed their solitary
justification. Moreover, we come—in following the answer made by the
generals in the public assembly to Theramenês and Thrasybulus—to a
new point in the case, which Xenophon lets out as it were indirectly,
in that confused manner which pervades his whole narrative of the
transaction. It is, however, a new point of extreme moment. The
generals replied that if any one was to blame for not having picked
up the drowning men, it was Theramenês and Thrasybulus themselves;
for it was they two to whom, together with various other trierarchs
and with forty-eight triremes, the generals had expressly confided
the performance of this duty; it was they two who were responsible
for its omission, not the generals. Nevertheless they, the generals,
made no charge against Theramenês and Thrasybulus, well knowing
that the storm had rendered the performance of the duty absolutely
impossible, and that it was therefore a complete justification for
one as well as for the other. They, the generals, at least could
do no more than direct competent men like these two trierarchs to
perform the task, and assign to them an adequate squadron for the
purpose; while they themselves with the main fleet went to attack
Eteonikus, and relieve Mitylênê. Diomedon, one of their number, had
wished after the battle to employ all the ships in the fleet for the
preservation of the drowning men, without thinking of anything else
until that was done. Erasinidês, on the contrary, wished that all
the fleet should move across at once against Mitylênê; Thrasyllus
said that they had ships enough to do both at once. Accordingly, it
was agreed that each general should set apart three ships from his
division, to make a squadron of forty-eight ships under Thrasybulus
and Theramenês. In making these statements, the generals produced
pilots and others, men actually in the battle as witnesses in general
confirmation.</p>

<p>Here, then, in this debate before the assembly, were two new and
important points publicly raised. First, Theramenês and Thrasybulus
denounced the generals as guilty of the death of these neglected
men; next, the generals affirmed that they had delegated the duty
to Theramenês and Thrasybulus themselves.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> If this latter were really true, how
came the generals, in their official despatch first sent home, to
say nothing about it? Euryptolemus, an advocate of the generals,
speaking in a subsequent stage of the proceedings, though we can
hardly doubt that the same topics were also urged in this very
assembly, while blaming the generals for such omission, ascribed it
to an ill-placed good-nature on their part, and reluctance to bring
Theramenês and Thrasybulus under the displeasure of the people.
Most of the generals, he said, were disposed to mention the fact
in their official despatch, but were dissuaded from doing so by
Periklês and Diomedon; an unhappy dissuasion, in his judgment, which
Theramenês and Thrasybulus had ungratefully requited by turning round
and accusing them all.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275"
class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>This remarkable statement of Euryptolemus, as to the intention
of the generals in wording the official despatch, brings us to a
closer consideration of what really passed between them on the
one side, and Theramenês and Thrasybulus on the other; which is
difficult to make out clearly, but which Diodorus represents in a
manner completely different from Xenophon. Diodorus states that the
generals were prevented partly by the storm, partly by the fatigue
and reluctance and alarm of their own seamen, from taking any steps
to pick up, what he calls, the dead bodies for burial; that they
suspected Theramenês and Thrasybulus, who went to Athens before them,
of intending to accuse them before the people, and that for this
reason they sent home intimation to the people that they had given
special orders to these two trierarchs to perform the duty. When
these letters were read in the public assembly, Diodorus says, the
Athenians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span> were
excessively indignant against Theramenês; who, however, defended
himself effectively and completely, throwing the blame back upon
the generals. He was thus forced, against his own will, and in
self-defence, to become the accuser of the generals, carrying with
him his numerous friends and partisans at Athens. And thus the
generals, by trying to ruin Theramenês, finally brought condemnation
upon themselves.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276"
class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Such is the narrative of Diodorus, in which it is implied that
the generals never really gave any special orders to Theramenês and
Thrasybulus, but falsely asserted afterwards that they had done
so, in order to discredit the accusation of Theramenês against
themselves. To a certain extent, this coincides with what was
asserted by Theramenês himself, two years afterwards, in his defence
before the Thirty, that he was not the first to accuse the generals;
they were the first to accuse him; affirming that they had ordered
him to undertake the duty, and that there was no sufficient reason to
hinder him from performing it; they were the persons who distinctly
pronounced the performance of the duty to be possible, while he had
said, from the beginning, that the violence of the storm was such
as even to forbid any movement in the water; much more, to prevent
rescue of the drowning men.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>Taking the accounts of Xenophon and Diodorus together, in
combination with the subsequent accusation and defence of Theramenês
at the time of the Thirty, and blending them so as to reject as
little as possible of either, I think it probable that the order
for picking up the exposed men was really given by the generals
to Theramenês, Thrasybulus, and other trierarchs; but<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span> that, first, a fatal
interval was allowed to elapse between the close of the battle and
the giving of such order; next, that the forty-eight triremes talked
of for the service, and proposed to be furnished by drafts of three
out of each general’s division, were probably never assembled; or,
if they assembled, were so little zealous in the business as to
satisfy themselves very easily that the storm was too dangerous to
brave, and that it was now too late. For when we read the version
of the transaction, even as given by Euryptolemus, we see plainly
that none of the generals, except Diomedon, was eager in the
performance of the task. It is a memorable fact, that of all the
eight generals, not one of them undertook the business in person,
although its purpose was to save more than a thousand drowning
comrades from death.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278"
class="fnanchor">[278]</a> In a proceeding where every interval even
of five minutes was precious, they go to work in the most dilatory
manner, by determining that each general shall furnish three ships,
and no more, from his division. Now we know from the statement of
Xenophon, that, towards the close of the battle, the ships on both
sides were much dispersed.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Such collective direction therefore
would not be quickly realized; nor, until all the eight fractions
were united, together with the Samians and others, so as to make
the force complete, would Theramenês feel bound to go out upon
his preserving visitation. He doubtless disliked the service, as
we see that most of the generals did; while the crews also, who
had just got to land after having gained a victory, were thinking
most about rest and refreshment, and mutual congratulations.<a
id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> were glad to
find some excuse for staying in their moorings instead of going out
again to buffet what was doubtless unfavorable weather. Partly from
this want of zeal, coming in addition to the original delay, partly
from the bad weather, the duty remained unexecuted, and the seamen on
board the damaged ships were left to perish unassisted.</p>

<p>But presently arose the delicate, yet unavoidable question,
“How are we to account for the omission of this sacred duty, in
our official despatch to the Athenian people?” Here the generals
differed among themselves, as Euryptolemus expressly states: Periklês
and Diomedon carried it, against the judgment of their colleagues,
that in the official despatch, which was necessarily such as could
be agreed to by all, nothing should be said about the delegation
to Theramenês and others; the whole omission being referred to the
terrors of the storm. But though such was the tenor of the official
report, there was nothing to hinder the generals from writing home
and communicating individually with their friends in Athens as each
might think fit; and in these unofficial communications, from them as
well as from others who went home from the armament,—communications
not less efficacious than the official despatch, in determining
the tone of public feeling at Athens,—they did not disguise their
convictions that the blame of not performing the duty belonged to
Theramenês. Having thus a man like Theramenês to throw the blame
upon, they did not take pains to keep up the story of the intolerable
storm, but intimated that there had been nothing to hinder <i>him</i>
from performing the duty if he had chosen. It is this which he
accuses them of having advanced against him, so as to place him as
the guilty man before the Athenian public: it was this which made
him, in retaliation and self-defence, violent and unscrupulous in
denouncing them as the persons really blamable.<a id="FNanchor_281"
href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> As they<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> had made light of this
alleged storm, in casting the blame upon him, so he again made light
of it, and treated it as an insufficient excuse, in his denunciations
against them; taking care to make good use of their official
despatch, which virtually exonerated him, by its silence, from any
concern in the matter.</p>

<p>Such is the way in which I conceive the relations to have stood
between the generals on one side and Theramenês on the other, having
regard to all that is said both in Xenophon and in Diodorus. But the
comparative account of blame and recrimination between these two
parties is not the most important feature of the case. The really
serious inquiry is, as to the intensity or instant occurrence of
the storm. Was it really so instant and so dangerous, that the
duty of visiting the wrecks could not be performed, either before
the ships went back to Arginusæ, or afterwards? If we take the
circumstances of the case, and apply them to the habits and feelings
of the English navy, if we suppose more than one thousand seamen,
late comrades in the victory, distributed among twenty damaged
and helpless hulls, awaiting the moment when these hulls would
fill and consign them all to a watery grave, it must have been a
frightful storm indeed, which would force an English admiral even
to go back to his moorings leaving these men so exposed, or which
would deter him, if he were at his moorings, from sending out the
very first and nearest ships at hand to save them. And granting the
danger to be such that he hesitated to give the order, there<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span> would probably be
found officers and men to volunteer, against the most desperate
risks, in a cause so profoundly moving all their best sympathies.
Now, unfortunately for the character of Athenian generals, officers,
and men, at Arginusæ,—for the blame belongs, though in unequal
proportions, to all of them,—there exists here strong presumptive
proof that the storm on this occasion was not such as would have
deterred any Grecian seamen animated by an earnest and courageous
sense of duty. We have only to advert to the conduct and escape
of Eteonikus and the Peloponnesian fleet from Mitylênê to Chios;
recollecting that Mitylênê was separated from the promontory of
Kanê on the Asiatic mainland, and from the isles of Arginusæ, by a
channel only one hundred and twenty stadia broad,<a id="FNanchor_282"
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> about fourteen
English miles. Eteonikus, apprized of the defeat by the Peloponnesian
official signal-boat, desired that boat to go out of the harbor,
and then to sail into it again with deceptive false news, to the
effect that the Peloponnesians had gained a complete victory: he
then directed his seamen, after taking their dinners, to depart
immediately, and the masters of the merchant vessels silently to put
their cargoes aboard, and get to sea also. The whole fleet, triremes
and merchant vessels both, thus went out of the harbor of Mitylênê
and made straight for Chios, whither they arrived in safety; the
merchant vessels carrying their sails, and having what Xenophon
calls “a fair wind.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283"
class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Now it is scarcely possi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>ble that all this could
have taken place, had there blown during this time an intolerable
storm between Mitylênê and Arginusæ. If the weather was such as
to allow of the safe transit of Eteonikus and all his fleet from
Mitylênê to Chios, it was not such as to form a legitimate obstacle
capable of deterring any generous Athenian seaman, still less a
responsible officer, from saving his comrades exposed on the wrecks
near Arginusæ. Least of all was it such as ought to have hindered the
attempt to save them, even if such attempt had proved unsuccessful.
And here the gravity of the sin consists, in having remained inactive
while the brave men on the wrecks were left to be drowned. All this
reasoning, too, assumes the fleet to have been already brought back
to its moorings at Arginusæ, discussing only how much was practicable
to effect after that moment, and leaving untouched the no less
important question, why the drowning men were not picked up before
the fleet went back.</p>

<p>I have thought it right to go over these considerations,
indispensable to the fair appreciation of this memorable event, in
order that the reader may understand the feelings of the assembly and
the public of Athens, when the generals stood before them, rebutting
the accusations of Theramenês and recriminating in their turn against
him. The assembly had before them the grave and deplorable fact, that
several hundreds of brave seamen had been suffered to drown on the
wrecks, without the least effort to rescue them. In explanation of
this fact, they had not only no justification, at once undisputed
and satisfactory, but not even any straightforward, consistent, and
uncontradicted statement of facts. There were discrepancies among the
generals themselves, comparing their official with their unofficial,
as well as with their present statements, and contradictions between
them and Theramenês, each having denied the sufficiency of the storm
as a vindication for the neglect imputed to the other. It was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span> impossible that
the assembly could be satisfied to acquit the generals on such a
presentation of the case; nor could they well know how to apportion
the blame between them and Theramenês. The relatives of the men
left to perish would be doubtless in a state of violent resentment
against one or other of the two, perhaps against both. Under these
circumstances, it could hardly have been the sufficiency of their
defence,—it must have been rather the apparent generosity of their
conduct towards Theramenês, in formally disavowing all charge of
neglect against him, though he had advanced a violent charge against
them,—which produced the result that we read in Xenophon. The defence
of the generals was listened to with favor and seemed likely to
prevail with the majority.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Many individuals present offered
themselves as bail for the generals, in order that the latter
might be liberated from custody: but the debate had been so much
prolonged—we see from hence that there must have been a great deal
of speaking—that it was now dark, so that no vote could be taken,
because the show of hands was not distinguishable. It was therefore
resolved to adjourn the whole decision until another assembly;
but that in the mean time the senate should meet, should consider
what would be the proper mode of trying and judging the generals,
and should submit a proposition to that effect to the approaching
assembly.</p>

<p>It so chanced that immediately after this first assembly, during
the interval before the meeting of the senate or the holding of
the second assembly, the three days of the solemn annual festival
called Apaturia intervened; early days in the month of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> October. This was
the characteristic festival of the Ionic race; handed down from a
period anterior to the constitution of Kleisthenês, and to the ten
new tribes each containing so many demes, and bringing together the
citizens in their primitive unions of family, gens, phratry, etc.,
the aggregate of which had originally constituted the four Ionic
tribes, now superannuated. At the Apaturia, the family ceremonies
were gone through; marriages were enrolled, acts of adoption were
promulgated and certified, the names of youthful citizens first
entered on the gentile and phratric roll; sacrifices were jointly
celebrated by these family assemblages to Zeus Phratrius, Athênê,
and other deities, accompanied with much festivity and enjoyment. A
solemnity like this, celebrated every year, naturally provoked in
each of these little unions, questions of affectionate interest: “Who
are those that were with us last year, but are not here now? The
absent, where are they? The deceased, where or how did they die?”
Now the crews of the twenty-five Athenian triremes, lost at the
battle of Arginusæ, at least all those among them who were freemen,
had been members of some one of these family unions, and were missed
on this occasion. The answer to the above inquiry, in their case,
would be one alike melancholy and revolting: “They fought like
brave men, and had their full share in the victory: their trireme
was broken, disabled, and made a wreck, in the battle: aboard this
wreck they were left to perish, while their victorious generals and
comrades made not the smallest effort to preserve them.” To hear
this about fathers, brothers, and friends,—and to hear it in the
midst of a sympathizing family circle,—was well calculated to stir
up an agony of shame, sorrow, and anger, united; an intolerable
sentiment, which required as a satisfaction, and seemed even to
impose as a duty, the punishment of those who had left these brave
comrades to perish. Many of the gentile unions, in spite of the
usually festive and cheerful character of the Apaturia, were so
absorbed by this sentiment, that they clothed themselves in black
garments and shaved their heads in token of mourning, resolving
to present themselves in this guise at the coming assembly, and
to appease the manes of their abandoned kinsmen by every possible
effort to procure retribution on the generals.<a id="FNanchor_285"
href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span></p> <p>Xenophon in
his narrative describes this burst of feeling at the Apaturia as
false and factitious, and the men in mourning as a number of hired
impostors, got up by the artifices of Theramenês,<a id="FNanchor_286"
href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> to destroy the
generals. But the case was one in which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> no artifice was needed. The universal
and self-acting stimulants of intense human sympathy stand here
so prominently marked, that it is not simply superfluous but even
misleading, to look behind for the gold and machinations of a
political instigator. Theramenês might do all that he could to turn
the public displeasure against the generals, and to prevent it
from turning against himself: it is also certain that he did much
to annihilate their defence. He may thus have had some influence
in directing the sentiment against them, but he could have had
little or none in creating it. Nay, it is not too much to say that
no factitious agency of this sort could ever have prevailed on the
Athenian public to desecrate such a festival as the Apaturia, by all
the insignia of mourning. If they did so, it could only have been
through some internal emotion alike spontaneous and violent, such as
the late event was well calculated to arouse.</p>

<p>Moreover, what can be more improbable than the allegation that a
great number of men were hired to personate the fathers or brothers
of deceased Athenian citizens, all well known to their really
surviving kinsmen? What more improbable, than the story that numbers
of men would suffer themselves to be hired, not merely to put on
black clothes for the day, which might be taken off in the evening,
but also to shave their heads, thus stamping upon themselves an
ineffaceable evidence of the fraud, until the hair had grown again?
That a cunning man, like Theramenês, should thus distribute his
bribes to a number of persons, all presenting naked heads which
testified his guilt, when there were real kinsmen surviving to prove
the fact of personation? That having done this, he should never be
arraigned or accused for it afterwards,—neither during the prodigious
reaction of feeling which took place after the condemnation of the
generals, which Xenophon himself so strongly attests, and which
fell so heavily upon Kallixenus and others,—nor by his bitter enemy
Kritias, under the government of the Thirty? Not only Theramenês is
never mentioned as having been afterwards accused, but, for aught
that appears, he preserved his political influence and standing, with
little if any abatement. This is one forcible<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> reason among many others, for
disbelieving the bribes and the all-pervading machinations which
Xenophon represents him as having put forth, in order to procure
the condemnation of the generals. His speaking in the first public
assembly, and his numerous partisans voting in the second, doubtless
contributed much to that result, and by his own desire. But to
ascribe to his bribes and intrigues the violent and overruling
emotion of the Athenian public, is, in my judgment, a supposition
alike unnatural and preposterous both with regard to them and with
regard to him.</p>

<p>When the senate met, after the Apaturia, to discharge the duty
confided to it by the last public assembly, of determining in
what manner the generals should be judged, and submitting their
opinion for the consideration of the next assembly, the senator
Kallixenus—at the instigation of Theramenês, if Xenophon is to be
believed—proposed, and the majority of the senate adopted, the
following resolution: “The Athenian people having already heard, in
the previous assembly, both the accusation and the defence of the
generals, shall at once come to a vote on the subject by tribes. For
each tribe two urns shall be placed, and the herald of each tribe
shall proclaim: All citizens who think the generals guilty, for not
having rescued the warriors who had conquered in the battle, shall
drop their pebbles into the foremost urn; all who think otherwise,
into the hindmost. Should the generals be pronounced guilty, by the
result of the voting, they shall be delivered to the Eleven, and
punished with death; their property shall be confiscated, the tenth
part being set apart for the goddess Athênê.”<a id="FNanchor_287"
href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> One single vote was
to embrace the case of all the eight generals.<a id="FNanchor_288"
href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>The unparalleled burst of mournful and vindictive feeling at the
festival of the Apaturia, extending by contagion from the relatives
of the deceased to many other citizens,—and the probability thus
created that the coming assembly would sanction the most violent
measures against the generals,—probably emboldened Kallixenus
to propose, and prompted the senate to adopt, this deplorable
resolution. As soon as the assembly met, it was read and moved by
Kallixenus himself, as coming from the senate in discharge of the
commission imposed upon them by the people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span></p>

<p>It was heard by a large portion of the assembly with well-merited
indignation. Its enormity consisted in breaking through the
established constitutional maxims and judicial practices of the
Athenian democracy. It deprived the accused generals of all fair
trial; alleging, with a mere faint pretence of truth which was little
better than utter falsehood, that their defence as well as their
accusation had been heard in the preceding assembly. Now there has
been no people, ancient or modern, in whose view the formalities
of judicial trial were habitually more sacred and indispensable
than in that of the Athenians; formalities including ample notice
beforehand to the accused party, with a measured and sufficient space
of time for him to make his defence before the dikasts; while those
dikasts were men who had been sworn beforehand as a body, yet were
selected by lot for each occasion as individuals. From all these
securities the generals were now to be debarred; and submitted,
for their lives, honors, and fortunes, to a simple vote of the
unsworn public assembly, without hearing or defence. Nor was this
all. One single vote was to be taken in condemnation or absolution
of the eight generals collectively. Now there was a rule in Attic
judicial procedure, called the psephism of Kannônus,—originally
adopted, we do not know when, on the proposition of a citizen of that
name, as a psephism or decree for some particular case, but since
generalized into common practice, and grown into great prescriptive
reverence,—which peremptorily forbade any such collective trial or
sentence, and directed that a separate judicial vote should, in all
cases, be taken for or against each accused party. The psephism of
Kannônus, together with all the other respected maxims of Athenian
criminal justice, was here audaciously trampled under foot.<a
id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span></p>
<p>As soon as the resolution was read in the public assembly,
Euryptolemus, an intimate friend of the generals, denounced it
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span> grossly
illegal and unconstitutional, presenting a notice of indictment
against Kallixenus, under the Graphê Paranomôn, for having proposed a
resolution of that tenor. Several other citizens supported the notice
of indictment, which, according to the received practice of Athens,
would arrest the farther progress of the measure until the trial of
its proposer had been consummated. Nor was there ever any proposition
made at Athens, to which the Graphê Paranomôn more closely and
righteously applied.</p>

<p>But the numerous partisans of Kallixenus—especially the men who
stood by in habits of mourning, with shaven heads, agitated with
sad recollections and thirst of vengeance—were in no temper to
respect this constitutional impediment to the discussion of what
had already been passed by the senate. They loudly clamored, that
“it was intolerable to see a small knot of citizens thus hindering
the assembled people from doing what they chose:” and one of their
number, Lykiskus, even went so far as to threaten that those who
tendered the indictment against Kallixenus should be judged by
the same vote along with the generals, if they would not let the
assembly proceed to consider and determine on the motion just read.<a
id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
The excited disposition of the large party thus congregated, farther
inflamed by this menace of Lykiskus, was wound up to its highest
pitch by various other speakers; especially by one, who stood forward
and said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>
“Athenians! I was myself a wrecked man in the battle; I escaped
only by getting upon an empty meal-tub; but my comrades, perishing
on the wrecks near me, implored me, if I should myself be saved, to
make known to the Athenian people, that their generals had abandoned
to death warriors who had bravely conquered in behalf of their
country.” Even in the most tranquil state of the public mind, such a
communication of the last words of these drowning men, reported by an
ear-witness, would have been heard with emotion; but under the actual
predisposing excitement, it went to the inmost depth of the hearers’
souls, and marked the generals as doomed men.<a id="FNanchor_291"
href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Doubtless there
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> other
similar statements, not expressly mentioned to us, bringing to view
the same fact in other ways, and all contributing to aggravate the
violence of the public manifestations; which at length reached such
a point, that Euryptolemus was forced to withdraw his notice of
indictment against Kallixenus.</p>

<p id="Socrates">Now, however, a new form of resistance sprung up,
still preventing the proposition from being taken into consideration
by the assembly. Some of the prytanes,—or senators of the presiding
tribe, on that occasion the tribe Antiochis,—the legal presidents
of the assembly, refused to entertain or put the question; which,
being illegal and unconstitutional, not only inspired them with
aversion, but also rendered them personally open to penalties.
Kallixenus employed against them the same menaces which Lykiskus
had uttered against Euryptolemus: he threatened, amidst encouraging
clamor from many persons in the assembly, to include them in the
same accusation with the generals. So intimidated were the prytanes
by the incensed manifestations of the assembly, that all of them,
except one, relinquished their opposition, and agreed to put the
question. The single obstinate prytanis, whose refusal no menace
could subdue, was a man whose name we read with peculiar interest,
and in whom an impregnable adherence to law and duty was only
one among many other titles to reverence. It was the philosopher
Sokratês; on this trying occasion, once throughout a life of seventy
years, discharging a political office, among the fifty senators taken
by lot from the tribe Antiochis. Sokratês could not be induced to
withdraw his protest, so that the question was ultimately put by
the remaining prytanes without his concurrence.<a id="FNanchor_292"
href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> It should be observed
that his resistance did not imply any opinion as to the guilt
or innocence of the generals, but applied simply to the illegal
and unconstitutional proposition now submitted for determining
their fate;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> a
proposition, which he must already have opposed once before, in his
capacity of member of the senate.</p>

<p>The constitutional impediments having been thus violently
overthrown, the question was regularly put by the prytanes to the
assembly. At once the clamorous outcry ceased, and those who had
raised it resumed their behavior of Athenian citizens, patient
hearers of speeches and opinions directly opposed to their own.
Nothing is more deserving of notice than this change of demeanor.
The champions of the men drowned on the wrecks had resolved to
employ as much force as was required to eliminate those preliminary
constitutional objections, in themselves indisputable, which
precluded the discussion. But so soon as the discussion was
once begun, they were careful not to give to the resolution the
appearance of being carried by force. Euryptolemus, the personal
friend of the generals, was allowed not only to move an amendment
negativing the proposition of Kallixenus, but also to develop it in
a long speech, which Xenophon sets before us.<a id="FNanchor_293"
href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>His speech is one of great skill and judgment in reference to the
case before him and to the temper of the assembly. Beginning with a
gentle censure on his friends, the generals Periklês and Diomedon,
for having prevailed on their colleagues to abstain from mentioning,
in their first official letter, the orders given to Theramenês, he
represented them as now in danger of becoming victims to the base
conspiracy of the latter, and threw himself upon the justice of the
people to grant them a fair trial. He besought the people to take
full time to instruct themselves before they pronounced so solemn
and irrevocable a sentence; to trust only to their own judgment, but
at the same time to take security that judgment should be pronounced
after full information and impartial hearing, and thus to escape that
bitter and unavailing remorse which would otherwise surely follow.
He proposed that the generals should be tried each separately,
according to the psephism of Kannônus, with proper notice, and
ample time allowed for the defence as well as for the accusation;
but that, if found guilty, they should suffer the heaviest and
most disgraceful penalties, his own relation Periklês the first.
This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span> was the only
way of striking the guilty, of saving the innocent, and of preserving
Athens from the ingratitude and impiety of condemning to death,
without trial as well as contrary to law, generals who had just
rendered to her so important a service. And what could the people be
afraid of? Did they fear lest the power of trial should slip out of
their hands, that they were so impatient to leap over all the delays
prescribed by the law?<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a> To the worst of public traitors,
Aristarchus, they had granted a day with full notice for trial, with
all the legal means for making his defence: and would they now show
such flagrant contrariety of measure to victorious and faithful
officers? “Be not <i>ye</i> (he said) the men to act thus, Athenians.
The laws are your own work; it is through them that ye chiefly
hold your greatness: cherish them, and attempt not any proceeding
without their sanction.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"
class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>Euryptolemus then shortly recapitulated the proceedings after
the battle, with the violence of the storm which had prevented
approach to the wrecks; adding that one of the generals, now in
peril, had himself been on board a broken ship, and had only escaped
by a fortunate accident.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Gaining courage from his own harangue,
he concluded by reminding the Athenians of the brilliancy of the
victory, and by telling them that they ought in justice to wreath
the brows of the conquerors, instead of following those wicked
advisers who pressed for their execution.<a id="FNanchor_297"
href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>It is no small proof of the force of established habits of public
discussion, that the men in mourning and with shaven heads, who had
been a few minutes before in a state of furious excitement, should
patiently hear out a speech so effective and so conflicting with
their strongest sentiments as this of Euryptolemus. Perhaps others
may have spoken also; but Xenophon does not men<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span>tion them. It is remarkable that he does
not name Theramenês as taking any part in this last debate.</p>

<p>The substantive amendment proposed by Euryptolemus was that the
generals should be tried each separately, according to the psephism
of Kannônus; implying notice to be given to each, of the day of
trial, and full time for each to defend himself. This proposition,
as well as that of the senate moved by Kallixenus, was submitted to
the vote of the assembly; hands being separately held up, first for
one, next for the other. The prytanes pronounced the amendment of
Euryptolemus to be carried. But a citizen named Meneklês impeached
their decision as wrong or invalid, alleging seemingly some
informality or trick in putting the question, or perhaps erroneous
report of the comparative show of hands. We must recollect that in
this case the prytanes were declared partisans. Feeling that they
were doing wrong in suffering so illegal a proposition as that of
Kallixenus to be put at all, and that the adoption of it would
be a great public mischief, they would hardly scruple to try and
defeat it even by some unfair manœuvre. But the exception taken by
Meneklês constrained them to put the question over again, and they
were then obliged to pronounce that the majority was in favor of the
proposition of Kallixenus.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298"
class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_204">[p. 204]</span></p> <p>That proposition was shortly
afterwards carried into effect by disposing the two urns for each
tribe, and collecting the votes of the citizens individually.
The condemnatory vote prevailed, and all the eight generals were
thus found guilty; whether by a large or a small majority we
should have been glad to learn, but are not told. The majority
was composed mostly of those who acted under a feeling of genuine
resentment against the generals, but in part also of the friends and
partisans of Theramenês,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"
class="fnanchor">[299]</a> not inconsiderable in number. The six
generals then at Athens,—Periklês (son of the great statesman of
that name by Aspasia), Diomedon, Erasinidês, Thrasyllus, Lysias, and
Aristokratês,—were then delivered to the Eleven, and perished by the
usual draught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>
of hemlock; their property being confiscated, as the decree of the
senate prescribed.</p>

<p>Respecting the condemnation of these unfortunate men, pronounced
without any of the recognized tutelary preliminaries for accused
persons, there can be only one opinion. It was an act of violent
injustice and illegality, deeply dishonoring the men who passed it,
and the Athenian character generally. In either case, whether the
generals were guilty or innocent, this censure is deserved, for
judicial precautions are not less essential in dealing with the
guilty than with the innocent. But it is deserved in an aggravated
form, when we consider that the men against whom such injustice was
perpetrated, had just come from achieving a glorious victory. Against
the democratical constitution of Athens, it furnishes no ground for
censure, nor against the habits and feelings which that constitution
tended to implant in the individual citizen. Both the one and the
other strenuously forbade the deed; nor could the Athenians ever
have so dishonored themselves, if they had not, under a momentary
ferocious excitement, risen in insurrection not less against the
forms of their own democracy, than against the most sacred restraints
of their habitual constitutional morality.</p>

<p>If we wanted proof of this, the facts of the immediate future
would abundantly supply it. After a short time had elapsed, every man
in Athens became heartily ashamed of the deed.<a id="FNanchor_300"
href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> A vote of the public
assembly was passed,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301"
class="fnanchor">[301]</a> decreeing that those who had misguided
the people on this occasion ought to be brought to judicial trial,
that Kallixenus with four others should be among the number, and that
bail should be taken for their appearance. This was accordingly done,
and the parties were kept under custody of the sureties themselves,
who were responsible for their appearance on the day of trial. But
presently both foreign misfortunes and internal sedition began to
press too heavily on Athens to leave any room for other thoughts,
as we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span>
see in the <a href="#Chap_65">next chapter</a>. Kallixenus and his
accomplices found means to escape before the day of trial arrived,
and remained in exile until after the dominion of the Thirty and
the restoration of the democracy. Kallixenus then returned under
the general amnesty. But the general amnesty protected him only
against legal pursuit, not against the hostile memory of the
people. “Detested by all, he died of hunger,” says Xenophon;<a
id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
a memorable proof how much the condemnation of these six generals
shocked the standing democratical sentiment at Athens.</p>

<p>From what cause did this temporary burst of wrong arise, so
foreign to the habitual character of the people? Even under the
strongest political provocation, and towards the most hated
traitors,—as Euryptolemus himself remarked, by citing the case of
Aristarchus,—after the Four Hundred as well as after the Thirty,
the Athenians never committed the like wrong, never deprived an
accused party of the customary judicial securities. How then came
they to do it here, where the generals condemned were not only
not traitors, but had just signalized themselves by a victorious
combat? No Theramenês could have brought about this phenomenon;
no deep-laid oligarchical plot is, in my judgment, to be called
in as an explanation.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"
class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The true explanation is different, and
of serious moment to state. Political hatred, intense as it might
be, was never dissociated, in the mind of a citizen of Athens, from
the democratical forms of procedure: but the men, who stood out here
as actors, had broken loose from the obligations of citizenship
and commonwealth, and surrendered themselves, heart and soul, to
the family sympathies and antipathies; feelings first kindled, and
justly kindled, by the thought that their friends and relatives
had been left to perish unheeded on the wrecks; next, inflamed
into preternatural and overwhelming violence by the festival of
the Apaturia, where all the religious traditions connected with
the ancient family tie, all those associations which imposed upon
the relatives of a murdered man the duty of pursuing the murderer,
were expanded into detail and worked up by their appropriate
renovating solemnity. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p.
207]</span> garb of mourning and the shaving of the head—phenomena
unknown at Athens, either in a political assembly or in a religious
festival—were symbols of temporary transformation in the internal
man. He could think of nothing but his drowning relatives, together
with the generals as having abandoned them to death, and his own duty
as survivor to insure to them vengeance and satisfaction for such
abandonment. Under this self-justifying impulse, the shortest and
surest proceeding appeared the best, whatever amount of political
wrong it might entail:<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304"
class="fnanchor">[304]</a> nay, in this case it appeared the only
proceeding really sure, since the interposition of the proper
judicial delays, coupled with severance of trial on successive days,
according to the psephism of Kannônus, would probably have saved
the lives of five out of the six generals, if not of all the six.
When we reflect that such absorbing sentiment was common, at one and
the same time, to a large proportion of the Athenians, we shall see
the explanation of that misguided vote, both of the senate and of
the ekklesia, which sent the six generals to an illegal ballot, and
of the subsequent ballot which condemned them. Such is the natural
behavior of those who, having for the moment forgotten their sense of
political commonwealth, become degraded into exclusive family men.
The family affections, productive as they are of so large an amount
of gentle sympathy and mutual happiness in the interior circle, are
also liable to generate disregard, malice, sometimes even ferocious
vengeance, towards others. Powerful towards good generally, they
are not less powerful occasionally towards evil; and require, not
less than the selfish propensities, constant subordinating control
from that moral reason which contemplates for its end the security
and happiness of all. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p.
208]</span> when a man, either from low civilization, has never known
this large moral reason,—or when from some accidental stimulus,
righteous in the origin, but wrought up into fanaticism by the
conspiring force of religious as well as family sympathies, he comes
to place his pride and virtue in discarding its supremacy,—there
is scarcely any amount of evil or injustice which he may not be
led to perpetrate, by a blind obedience to the narrow instincts of
relationship. “Ces pères de famille sont capables de tout,” was the
satirical remark of Talleyrand upon the gross public jobbing so
largely practised by those who sought place or promotion for their
sons. The same words understood in a far more awful sense, and
generalized for other cases of relationship, sum up the moral of this
melancholy proceeding at Athens.</p>

<p>Lastly, it must never be forgotten that the generals themselves
were also largely responsible in the case. Through the unjustifiable
fury of the movement against them, they perished like innocent
men, without trial, “<i>inauditi et indefensi, tamquam innocentes,
perierunt</i>;” but it does not follow that they were really innocent.
I feel persuaded that neither with an English, nor French, nor
American fleet, could such events have taken place as those which
followed the victory of Arginusæ. Neither admiral nor seamen, after
gaining a victory and driving off the enemy, could have endured
the thoughts of going back to their anchorage, leaving their own
disabled wrecks unmanageable on the waters, with many living comrades
aboard, helpless, and depending upon extraneous succor for all their
chance of escape. That the generals at Arginusæ did this, stands
confessed by their own advocate Euryptolemus,<a id="FNanchor_305"
href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> though they must have
known well the condition of disabled ships after a naval combat,
and some ships even of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p.
209]</span> the victorious fleet were sure to be disabled. If these
generals, after their victory, instead of sailing back to land, had
employed themselves first of all in visiting the crippled ships,
there would have been ample time to perform this duty, and to save
all the living men aboard, before the storm came on. This is the
natural inference, even upon their own showing; this is what any
English, French, or American naval commander would have thought
it an imperative duty to do. What degree of blame is imputable to
Theramenês, and how far the generals were discharged by shifting the
responsibility to him, is a point which we cannot now determine.
But the storm, which is appealed to as a justification of both,
rests upon evidence too questionable to serve that purpose, where
the neglect of duty was so serious, and cost the lives probably of
more than one thousand brave men. At least, the Athenian people at
home, when they heard the criminations and recriminations between the
generals on one side and Theramenês on the other,—each of them in his
character of accuser implying that the storm was no valid obstacle,
though each, if pushed for a defence, fell back upon it as a resource
in case of need,—the Athenian people could not but look upon the
storm more as an afterthought to excuse previous omissions, than as
a terrible reality nullifying all the ardor and resolution of men
bent on doing their duty. It was in this way that the intervention of
Theramenês chiefly contributed to the destruction of the generals,
not by those manœuvres ascribed to him in Xenophon: he destroyed
all belief in the storm as a real and all-covering hindrance. The
general impression of the public at Athens—in my opinion, a natural
and unavoidable impression—was, that there had been most culpable
negligence in regard to the wrecks, through which negligence alone
the seamen on board perished. This negligence dishonors, more or
less, the armament at Arginusæ as well as the generals: but the
generals were the persons responsible to the public at home, who
felt for the fate of the deserted seamen more justly as well as more
generously than their comrades in the fleet.</p>

<p>In spite, therefore, of the guilty proceeding to which a furious
exaggeration of this sentiment drove the Athenians,—in spite of the
sympathy which this has naturally and justly procured for<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span> the condemned
generals,—the verdict of impartial history will pronounce that the
sentiment itself was well founded, and that the generals deserved
censure and disgrace. The Athenian people might with justice proclaim
to them: “Whatever be the grandeur of your victory, we can neither
rejoice in it ourselves, nor allow you to reap honor from it, if we
find that you have left many hundreds of those who helped in gaining
it to be drowned on board the wrecks without making any effort to
save them, when such effort might well have proved successful.”</p>

  FROM THE BATTLE OF ARGINUSÆ TO THE RESTORATION OF THE
  DEMOCRACY AT ATHENS, AFTER THE EXPULSION OF THE
  THIRTY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> victory of Arginusæ
gave for the time decisive mastery of the Asiatic seas to the
Athenian fleet; and is even said to have so discouraged the
Lacedæmonians, as to induce them to send propositions of peace to
Athens. But this statement<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a> is open to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span> much doubt, and I think it most
probable that no such propositions were made. Great as the victory
was, we look in vain for any positive results accruing to Athens.
After an unsuccessful attempt on Chios, the victorious fleet went
to Samos, where it seems to have remained until the following year,
without any farther movements than were necessary for the purpose of
procuring money.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eteonikus, who collected the remains of the defeated
Peloponnesian fleet at Chios, being left unsupplied with money by
Cyrus, found himself much straitened, and was compelled to leave
the seamen unpaid. During the later summer and autumn, these men
maintained themselves by laboring for hire on the Chian lands; but
when winter came, this resource ceased, so that they found themselves
unable to procure even clothes or shoes. In such forlorn condition,
many of them entered into a conspiracy to assail and plunder the town
of Chios; a day was named for the enterprise, and it was agreed that
the conspirators should know each other by wearing a straw, or reed.
Informed of the design, Eteonikus was at the same time intimidated by
the number of these straw-bearers; he saw that if he dealt with the
conspirators openly and ostensibly, they might perhaps rush to arms
and succeed in plundering the town; at any rate, a conflict would
arise in which many of the allies would be slain, which would produce
the worst effect upon all future operations. Accordingly, resorting
to stratagem, he took with him a guard of fifteen men armed with
daggers, and marched through the town of Chios. Meeting presently
one of these straw-bearers,—a man with a complaint in his eyes,
coming out of a surgeon’s house,—he directed his guards to put the
man to death on the spot. A crowd gathered round, with astonishment
as well as sympathy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p.
212]</span> and inquired on what ground the man was put to death;
upon which Eteonikus ordered his guards to reply, that it was
because he wore a straw. The news became diffused, and immediately
the remaining persons who wore straws became so alarmed as to
throw their straws away.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307"
class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Eteonikus availed himself of the alarm to demand money from the
Chians, as a condition of carrying away this starving and perilous
armament. Having obtained from them a month’s pay, he immediately put
the troops on shipboard, taking pains to encourage them, and make
them fancy that he was unacquainted with the recent conspiracy.</p>

<p>The Chians and the other allies of Sparta presently assembled
at Ephesus to consult, and resolved, in conjunction with Cyrus, to
despatch envoys to the ephors, requesting that Lysander might be
sent out a second time as admiral. It was not the habit of Sparta
ever to send out the same man as admiral a second time, after his
year of service. Nevertheless, the ephors complied with the request
substantially, sending out Arakus as admiral, but Lysander along with
him, under the title of secretary, invested with all the real powers
of command.</p>

<p>Lysander, having reached Ephesus about the beginning of
<small>B.C.</small> 405, immediately applied himself with vigor
to renovate both Lacedæmonian power and his own influence. The
partisans in the various allied cities, whose favor he had
assiduously cultivated during his last year’s command, the clubs
and factious combinations, which he had organized and stimulated
into a partnership of mutual ambition, all hailed his return with
exultation. Discountenanced and kept down by the generous patriotism
of his predecessor Kallikratidas, they now sprang into renewed
activity, and became zealous in aiding Lysander to refit and augment
his fleet. Nor was Cyrus less hearty in his preference than before.
On arriving at Ephesus, Lysander went speedily to visit him at
Sardis, and solicited a renewal of the pecuniary aid. The young
prince said in reply that all the funds which he had received from
Susa had already been expended, with much more besides; in testimony
of which he exhibited a specification of the sums furnished to each
Peloponnesian officer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p.
213]</span> Nevertheless, such was his partiality for Lysander,
that he complied even with the additional demand now made, so as
to send him away satisfied. The latter was thus enabled to return
to Ephesus in a state for restoring the effective condition of
his fleet. He made good at once all the arrears of pay due to the
seamen, constituted new trierarchs, summoned Eteonikus with the
fleet from Chios, together with all the other scattered squadrons,
and directed that fresh triremes should be immediately put on the
stocks at Antandrus.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>In none of the Asiatic towns was the effect of Lysander’s
second advent felt more violently than at Milêtus. He had there
a powerful faction or association of friends, who had done their
best to hamper and annoy Kallikratidas on his first arrival, but
had been put to silence, and even forced to make a show of zeal, by
the straightforward resolution of that noble-minded admiral. Eager
to reimburse themselves for this humiliation, they now formed a
conspiracy, with the privity and concurrence of Lysander, to seize
the government for themselves. They determined, if Plutarch and
Diodorus are to be credited, to put down the existing democracy,
and establish an oligarchy in its place. But we cannot believe that
there could have existed a democracy at Milêtus, which had now been
for five years in dependence upon Sparta and the Persians jointly.
We must rather understand the movement as a conflict between two
oligarchical parties; the friends of Lysander being more thoroughly
self-seeking and anti-popular than their opponents, and perhaps
even crying them down, by comparison, as a democracy. Lysander lent
himself to the scheme, fanned the ambition of the conspirators,
who were at one time disposed to a compromise, and even betrayed
the government into a false security, by promises of support which
he never intended to fulfil. At the festival of the Dionysia, the
conspirators, rising in arms, seized forty of their chief opponents
in their houses, and three hundred more in the market-place; while
the government—confiding in the promises of Lysander, who affected
to reprove, but secretly continued instigating the insurgents—made
but a faint resistance. The three hundred and forty leaders thus
seized, probably men who had gone heartily<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span> along with Kallikratidas, were all put
to death; and a still larger number of citizens, not less than one
thousand, fled into exile. Milêtus thus passed completely into the
hands of the friends and partisans of Lysander.<a id="FNanchor_309"
href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>It would appear that factious movements in other towns, less
revolting in respect of bloodshed and perfidy, yet still of similar
character to that of Milêtus, marked the reappearance of Lysander
in Asia; placing the towns more and more in the hands of his
partisans. While thus acquiring greater ascendency among the allies,
Lysander received a summons from Cyrus to visit him at Sardis. The
young prince had just been sent for to come and visit his father
Darius, who was both old and dangerously ill, in Media. About to
depart for this purpose, he carried his confidence in Lysander so
far as to delegate to him the management of his satrapy and his
entire revenues. Besides his admiration for the superior energy and
capacity of the Greek character, with which he had only recently
contracted acquaintance; and besides his esteem for the personal
disinterestedness of Lysander, attested as it had been by the conduct
of the latter in the first visit and banquet at Sardis; Cyrus was
probably induced to this step by the fear of raising up to himself a
rival, if he trusted the like power to any Persian grandee. At the
same time that he handed over all his tributes and his reserved funds
to Lysander, he assured him of his steady friendship both towards
himself and towards the Lacedæmonians; and concluded by entreating
that he would by no means engage in any general action with the
Athenians, unless at great advantage in point of numbers. The defeat
of Arginusæ having strengthened his preference for this dilatory
policy, he promised that not only the Persian treasures, but also the
Phenician fleet, should be brought into active employment for the
purpose of crushing Athens.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"
class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Thus armed with an unprecedented command of Persian treasure, and
seconded by ascendent factions in all the allied cities, Lysander was
more powerful than any Lacedæmonian commander had ever been since
the commencement of the war. Having his fleet well paid, he could
keep it united, and direct it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p.
215]</span> whither he chose, without the necessity of dispersing it
in roving squadrons for the purpose of levying money. It is probably
from a corresponding necessity that we are to explain the inaction
of the Athenian fleet at Samos; for we hear of no serious operations
undertaken by it, during the whole year following the victory of
Arginusæ, although under the command of an able and energetic man,
Konon, together with Philoklês and Adeimantus; to whom were added,
during the spring of 405 <small>B.C.</small>, three other generals,
Tydeus, Menander, and Kephisodotus. It appears that Theramenês
also was put up and elected one of the generals, but rejected when
submitted to the confirmatory examination called the dokimasy.<a
id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The
fleet comprised one hundred and eighty triremes, rather a greater
number than that of Lysander; to whom they in vain offered battle
near his station at Ephesus. Finding him not disposed to a general
action, they seem to have dispersed to plunder Chios, and various
portions of the Asiatic coast; while Lysander, keeping his fleet
together, first sailed southward from Ephesus, stormed and plundered
a semi-Hellenic town in the Kerameikan gulf, named Kedreiæ, which
was in alliance with Athens, and thence proceeded to Rhodes.<a
id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
He was even bold enough to make an excursion across the Ægean to
the coast of Ægina and Attica, where he had an interview with
Agis, who came from Dekeleia to the sea-coast.<a id="FNanchor_313"
href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The Athenians
were prepared to follow him thither when they learned that he
had recrossed the Ægean, and he soon afterwards appeared with
all his fleet at the Hellespont, which important pass they had
left unguarded. Lysander went straight to Abydos, still the great
Peloponnesian station in the strait, occupied by Thorax as harmost
with a land force; and immediately proceeded to attack, both by
sea and land, the neighboring town of Lampsakus, which was taken
by storm. It was wealthy in every way, and abundantly stocked with
bread and wine, so that the soldiers obtained a large booty; but
Lysander left the free inhabitants untouched.<a id="FNanchor_314"
href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span></p>

<p>The Athenian fleet seems to have been employed in plundering
Chios, when it received news that the Lacedæmonian commander was
at the Hellespont engaged in the siege of Lampsakus. Either from
the want of money, or from other causes which we do not understand,
Konon and his colleagues were partly inactive, partly behindhand
with Lysander, throughout all this summer. They now followed him to
the Hellespont, sailing out on the sea-side of Chios and Lesbos,
away from the Asiatic coast, which was all unfriendly to them. They
reached Elæus, at the southern extremity of the Chersonese, with
their powerful fleet of one hundred and eighty triremes, just in
time to hear, while at their morning meal, that Lysander was already
master of Lampsakus; upon which they immediately proceeded up the
strait to Sestos, and from thence, after stopping only to collect a
few provisions, still farther up, to a place called Ægospotami.<a
id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Ægospotami, or Goat’s River—a name of fatal sound to all
subsequent Athenians—was a place which had nothing to recommend it
except that it was directly opposite to Lampsakus, separated by a
breadth of strait about one mile and three-quarters. But it was an
open beach, without harbor, without good anchorage, without either
houses or inhabitants or supplies; so that everything necessary for
this large army had to be fetched from Sestos, about one mile and
three-quarters distant even by land, and yet more distant by sea,
since it was necessary to round a headland. Such a station was highly
inconvenient and dangerous to an ancient naval armament, without any
organized commissariat; since the seamen, being compelled to go to
a distance from their ships in order to get their meals, were not
easily reassembled. Yet this was the station chosen by the Athenian
generals, with the full design of compelling Lysander to fight a
battle. But the Lacedæmonian admiral, who was at Lampsakus, in a good
harbor, with a well-furnished town in his rear, and a land-force
to coöperate, had no intention of accepting the challenge of his
enemies at the moment which suited their convenience. When the
Athenians sailed across the strait the next morning, they found all
his ships fully manned,—the men having already taken their morning
meal,—and ranged in perfect order of bat<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span>tle, with the land-force disposed ashore
to lend assistance; but with strict orders to await attack and not
to move forward. Not daring to attack him in such a position, yet
unable to draw him out by manœuvring all the day, the Athenians were
at length obliged to go back to Ægospotami. But Lysander directed a
few swift-sailing vessels to follow them, nor would he suffer his
own men to disembark until he thus ascertained that their seamen had
actually dispersed ashore.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316"
class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>For four successive days this same scene was repeated; the
Athenians becoming each day more confident in their own superior
strength, and more full of contempt for the apparent cowardice of
the enemy. It was in vain that Alkibiadês—who from his own private
forts in the Chersonese witnessed what was passing—rode up to the
station and remonstrated with the generals on the exposed condition
of the fleet on this open shore; urgently advising them to move round
to Sestos, where they would be both close to their own supplies and
safe from attack, as Lysander was at Lampsakus, and from whence
they could go forth to fight whenever they chose. But the Athenian
generals, especially Tydeus and Menander, disregarded his advice,
and even dismissed him with the insulting taunt, that they were
now in command, not he.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317"
class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Continuing thus in their exposed position,
the Athenian seamen on each successive day became more and more
careless of their enemy, and rash in dispersing the moment they
returned back to their own shore. At length, on the fifth<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span> day, Lysander ordered
the scout-ships, which he sent forth to watch the Athenians on their
return, to hoist a bright shield as a signal, as soon as they should
see the ships at their anchorage and the crews ashore in quest
of their meal. The moment he beheld this welcome signal, he gave
orders to his entire fleet to row across as swiftly as possible from
Lampsakus to Ægospotami, while Thorax marched along the strand with
the land-force in case of need. Nothing could be more complete or
decisive than the surprise of the Athenian fleet. All the triremes
were caught at their moorings ashore, some entirely deserted,
others with one or at most two of the three tiers of rowers which
formed their complement. Out of all the total of one hundred and
eighty, only twelve were found in tolerable order and preparation;<a
id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> the
trireme of Konon himself, together with a squadron of seven under his
immediate orders, and the consecrated ship called paralus, always
manned by the <i>élite</i> of the Athenian seamen, being among them. It
was in vain that Konon, on seeing the fleet of Lysander approaching,
employed his utmost efforts to get his fleet manned and in some
condition for resistance. The attempt was desperate, and the utmost
which he could do was to escape himself with the small squadron of
twelve, including the paralus. All the remaining triremes, nearly
one hundred and seventy in number, were captured by Lysander on
the shore, defenceless, and seemingly without the least attempt
on the part of any one to resist. He landed, and made prisoners
most of the crews ashore, though some of them fled and found
shelter in the neighboring forts. This prodigious and unparalleled
victory was obtained, not merely without the loss of a single
ship, but almost without that of a single man.<a id="FNanchor_319"
href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Of the number of prisoners taken by Lysander,—which must have been
very great, since the total crews of one hundred and eighty triremes
were not less than thirty-six thousand men,<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>—we<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> hear only of three
thousand or four thousand native Athenians, though this number
cannot represent all the native Athenians in the fleet. The Athenian
generals Philoklês and Adeimantus were certainly taken, and seemingly
all except Konon. Some of the defeated armament took refuge in
Sestos, which, however, surrendered with little resistance to the
victor. He admitted them to capitulation, on condition of their going
back immediately to Athens, and nowhere else: for he was desirous
to multiply as much as possible the numbers assembled in that city,
knowing well that the city would be the sooner starved out. Konon
too was well aware that, to go back to Athens, after the ruin of the
entire fleet, was to become one of the certain prisoners in a doomed
city, and to meet, besides, the indignation of his fellow-citizens,
so well deserved by the generals collectively. Accordingly, he
resolved to take shelter with Evagoras, prince of Salamis in the
island of Cyprus, sending the paralus, with some others of the twelve
fugitive triremes, to make known the fatal news at Athens. But before
he went thither, he crossed the strait—with singular daring, under
the circumstances—to Cape Abarnis in the territory of Lampsakus,
where the great sails of Lysander’s triremes, always taken out when a
trireme was made ready for fighting, lay seemingly unguarded. These
sails he took away, so as to lessen the enemy’s powers of pursuit,
and then made the best of his way to Cyprus.<a id="FNanchor_321"
href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>On the very day of the victory, Lysander sent off the Milesian
privateer Theopompus to proclaim it at Sparta, who, by a wonderful
speed of rowing, arrived there and made it known on the third
day after starting. The captured ships were towed off and the
prisoners carried across to Lampsakus, where a general assembly of
the victorious allies was convened, to determine in what manner
the prisoners should be treated. In this assembly, the most bitter
inculpations were put forth against the Athenians, as to the manner
in which they had recently dealt with their captives. The Athenian
general Philoklês, having captured a Co<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span>rinthian and Andrian trireme, had put
the crews to death by hurling them headlong from a precipice. It
was not difficult, in Grecian warfare, for each of the belligerents
to cite precedents of cruelty against the other; but in this
debate, some speakers affirmed that the Athenians had deliberated
what they should do with their prisoners, in case they had been
victorious at Ægospotami; and that they had determined—chiefly
on the motion of Philoklês, but in spite of the opposition of
Adeimantus—that they would cut off the right hands of all who were
captured. Whatever opinion Philoklês may have expressed personally,
it is highly improbable that any such determination was ever
taken by the Athenians.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322"
class="fnanchor">[322]</a> In this assembly of the allies,
however, besides all that could be said against Athens with truth,
doubtless the most extravagant falsehoods found ready credence.
All the Athenian prisoners captured at Ægospotami, three thousand
or four thousand in number, were massacred forthwith, Philoklês
himself at their head.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323"
class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The latter, taunted by Lysander with his
cruel execution of the Corinthian and Andrian crews, disdained to
return any answer, but placed himself in conspicuous vestments at
the head of the prisoners led out to execution. If we may believe
Pausanias, even the bodies of the prisoners were left unburied.</p>

<p>Never was a victory more complete in itself, more overwhelming
in its consequences, or more thoroughly disgraceful to the defeated
generals, taken collectively, than that of Ægospotami. Whether it
was in reality very glorious to Lysander, is doubtful; for it was
the general belief afterwards, not merely at Athens, but seemingly
in other parts of Greece also, that the Athenian fleet was sold to
perdition by the treason of some of its own commanders. Of this
suspicion both Konon and Philoklês stand clear. Adeimantus was named
as the chief traitor, and Tydeus along with him.<a id="FNanchor_324"
href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Konon even preferred
an accusation against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p.
221]</span> Adeimantus to this effect,<a id="FNanchor_325"
href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> probably by letter
written home from Cyprus, and perhaps by some formal declaration made
several years afterwards, when he returned to Athens as victor from
the battle of Knidus. The truth of the charge cannot be positively
demonstrated, but all the circumstances of the battle tend to render
it probable, as well as the fact that Konon alone among all the
generals was found in a decent state of preparation. Indeed we may
add, that the utter impotence and inertness of the numerous Athenian
fleet during the whole summer of 405 <small>B.C.</small>
conspire to suggest a similar explanation. Nor could Lysander,
master as he was of all the treasures of Cyrus, apply any portion of
them more efficaciously than in corrupting the majority of the six
Athenian generals, so as to nullify all the energy and ability of
Konon.</p>

<p>The great defeat of Ægospotami took place about September 405
<small>B.C.</small> It was made known at Peiræus by the
paralus, which arrived there during the night, coming straight from
the Hellespont. Such a moment of distress and agony had never been
experienced at Athens. The terrible disaster in Sicily had become
known to the people by degrees, without any authorized reporter; but
here was the official messenger, fresh from the scene, leaving no
room to question the magnitude of the disaster or the irreparable
ruin impending over the city. The wailing and cries of woe, first
beginning in Peiræus, were transmitted by the guards stationed on the
Long Walls up to the city. “On that night (says Xenophon) not a man
slept; not merely from sorrow for the past calamity, but from terror
for the future fate with which they themselves were now menaced, a
retribution for what they had themselves inflicted on the Æginetans,
Melians, Skionæans, and others.” After this night of misery, they
met in public assembly on the following day, resolving to make the
best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> preparations
they could for a siege, to put the walls in full state of defence,
and to block up two out of the three ports.<a id="FNanchor_326"
href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> For Athens thus to
renounce her maritime action, the pride and glory of the city ever
since the battle of Salamis, and to confine herself to a defensive
attitude within her own walls, was a humiliation which left nothing
worse to be endured except actual famine and surrender.</p>

<p>Lysander was in no hurry to pass from the Hellespont to Athens.
He knew that no farther corn-ships from the Euxine, and few supplies
from other quarters, could now reach Athens; and that the power
of the city to hold out against blockade must necessarily be very
limited; the more limited, the greater the numbers accumulated
within it. Accordingly, he permitted the Athenian garrisons
which capitulated, to go only to Athens, and nowhere else.<a
id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
His first measure was to make himself master of Chalkêdon and
Byzantium, where he placed the Lacedæmonian Sthenelaus as harmost,
with a garrison. Next, he passed to Lesbos, where he made similar
arrangements at Mitylênê and other cities. In them, as well as in
the other cities which now came under his power, he constituted an
oligarchy of ten native citizens, chosen from among his most daring
and unscrupulous partisans, and called a dekarchy, or dekadarchy, to
govern in conjunction with the Lacedæmonian harmost. Eteonikus was
sent to the Thracian cities which had been in dependence on Athens,
to introduce similar changes. In Thasus, however, this change was
stained by much bloodshed: there was a numerous philo-Athenian party
whom Lysander caused to be allured out of their place of concealment
into the temple of Heraklês, under the false assurance of an amnesty:
when assembled under this pledge, they were all put to death.<a
id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
Sanguinary proceedings of the like character, many in the presence
of Lysander himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p.
223]</span> together with large expulsions of citizens obnoxious to
his new dekarchies, signalized everywhere the substitution of Spartan
for Athenian ascendency.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> But nowhere, except at Samos, did the
citizens or the philo-Athenian party in the cities continue any
open hostility, or resist by force Lysander’s entrance and his
revolutionary changes. At Samos, they still held out: the people
had too much dread of that oligarchy, whom they had expelled in
the insurrection of 412 <small>B.C.</small>, to yield
without a farther struggle.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a> With this single reserve, every city in
alliance or dependence upon Athens submitted without resistance both
to the supremacy and the subversive measures of the Lacedæmonian
admiral.</p>

<p>The Athenian empire was thus annihilated, and Athens left
altogether alone. What was hardly less painful, all her kleruchs,
or out-citizens, whom she had formerly planted in Ægina, Melos, and
elsewhere throughout the islands, as well as in the Chersonese, were
now deprived of their properties and driven home.<a id="FNanchor_331"
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span> The leading philo-Athenians, too, at
Thasus, Byzantium, and other dependent cities,<a id="FNanchor_332"
href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> were forced to
abandon their homes in the like state of destitution, and to seek
shelter at Athens. Everything thus contributed to aggravate the
impoverishment, and the manifold suffering, physical as well as
moral, within her walls. Notwithstanding the pressure of present
calamity, however, and yet worse prospects for the future,
the Athenians prepared, as best they could, for an honorable
resistance.</p>

<p>It was one of their first measures to provide for the restoration
of harmony, and to interest all in the defence of the city, by
removing every sort of disability under which individual citizens
might now be suffering. Accordingly, Patrokleidês—having first
obtained special permission from the people, without which it would
have been unconstitutional to make any proposition for abrogating
sentences judicially passed, or releasing debtors regularly inscribed
in the public registers—submitted a decree such as had never been
mooted since the period when Athens was in a condition equally
desperate, during the advancing march of Xerxes. All debtors to the
state, either recent or of long standing; all official persons now
under investigation by the Logistæ, or about to be brought before the
dikastery on the usual accountability after office; all persons who
were liquidating by instalment debts due to the public, or had given
bail for sums thus owing; all persons who had been condemned either
to total disfranchisement, or to some specific disqualification or
disability; nay, even all those who, having been either members or
auxiliaries of the Four Hundred, had stood trial afterwards, and had
been condemned to any one of the above-mentioned penalties, all these
persons were pardoned and released; every register of the penalty or
condemnation being directed to be destroyed. From this comprehensive
pardon were excepted: Those among the Four Hundred who had fled from
Athens without standing their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p.
225]</span> trial; those who had been condemned either to exile or
to death by the Areopagus, or any of the other constituted tribunals
for homicide, or for subversion of the public liberty. Not merely the
public registers of all the condemnations thus released were ordered
to be destroyed, but it was forbidden, under severe penalties, to
any private citizen to keep a copy of them, or to make any allusion
to such misfortunes.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>Pursuant to the comprehensive amnesty and forgiveness adopted
by the people in this decree of Patrokleidês, the general body of
citizens swore to each other a solemn pledge of mutual harmony
in the acropolis.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The reconciliation thus introduced enabled
them the better to bear up under their distress;<a id="FNanchor_335"
href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> especially as the
persons relieved by the amnesty were, for the most part, not men
politically disaffected, like the exiles. To restore the latter,
was a measure which no one thought of: indeed, a large proportion
of them had been and were still at Dekeleia, assisting the
Lacedæmonians in their warfare against Athens.<a id="FNanchor_336"
href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But even the most
prudent internal measures could do little for Athens in reference
to her capital difficulty, that of procuring subsistence for the
numerous population within her walls, augmented every day by outlying
garrisons and citizens. She had long been shut out from the produce
of Attica by the garrison at Dekeleia; she obtained nothing from
Eubœa, and since the late defeat of Ægospotami, nothing from the
Euxine, from Thrace, or from the islands. Perhaps some corn may
still have reached her from Cyprus, and her small remaining navy
did what was possible to keep Peiræus supplied,<a id="FNanchor_337"
href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in spite of the
menacing prohibitions of Lysander, pre<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>ceding his arrival to block it up
effectually; but to accumulate any stock for a siege, was utterly
impossible.</p>

<p>At length, about November, 405 <small>B.C.</small>,
Lysander reached the Saronic gulf, having sent intimation beforehand,
both to Agis and to the Lacedæmonians, that he was approaching
with a fleet of two hundred triremes. The full Lacedæmonian and
Peloponnesian force (all except the Argeians), under king Pausanias,
was marched into Attica to meet him, and encamped in the precinct
of Acadêmus, at the gates of Athens; while Lysander, first coming
to Ægina with his overwhelming fleet of one hundred and fifty
sail; next, ravaging Salamis, blocked up completely the harbor of
Peiræus. It was one of his first measures to collect together the
remnant which he could find of the Æginetan and Melian populations,
whom Athens had expelled and destroyed; and to restore to them
the possession of their ancient islands.<a id="FNanchor_338"
href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Though all hope had now fled, the pride, the resolution, and the
despair of Athens, still enabled her citizens to bear up; nor was
it until some men actually began to die of hunger, that they sent
propositions to entreat peace. Even then their propositions were not
without dignity. They proposed to Agis to become allies of Sparta,
retaining their walls entire and their fortified harbor of Peiræus.
Agis referred the envoys to the ephors at Sparta, to whom he at
the same time transmitted a statement of their propositions. But
the ephors did not even deign to admit the envoys to an interview,
but sent messengers to meet them at Sellasia on the frontier of
Laconia, desiring that they would go back and come again prepared
with something more admissible, and acquainting them at the same
time that no proposition could be received which did not include the
demolition of the Long Walls, for a continuous length of ten stadia.
With this gloomy reply the envoys returned. Notwithstanding all the
suffering in the city, the senate and people would not consent even
to take such humiliating terms into consideration. A senator named
Archestratus, who advised that they should be accepted, was placed
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p. 227]</span> custody, and
a general vote was passed,<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a> on the proposition of Kleophon, forbidding
any such motion in future.</p>

<p>Such a vote demonstrates the courageous patience both of the
senate and the people; but unhappily it supplied no improved
prospects, while the suffering within the walls continued to become
more and more aggravated. Under these circumstances, Theramenês
offered himself to the people to go as envoy to Lysander and Sparta,
affirming that he should be able to detect what the real intention
of the ephors was in regard to Athens, whether they really intended
to root out the population and sell them as slaves. He pretended,
farther, to possess personal influence, founded on circumstances
which he could not divulge, such as would very probably insure a
mitigation of the doom. He was accordingly sent, in spite of strong
protest from the senate of Areopagus and others,—but with no express
powers to conclude,—simply to inquire and report. We hear with
astonishment that he remained more than three months as companion
of Lysander, who, he alleged, had detained him thus long, and had
only acquainted him, after the fourth month had begun, that no
one but the ephors had any power to grant peace. It seems to have
been the object of Theramenês, by this long delay, to wear out the
patience of the Athenians, and to bring them into such a state of
intolerable suffering, that they would submit to any terms of peace
which would only bring provisions into the town. In this scheme he
completely succeeded; and considering how great were the privations
of the people even at the moment of his departure, it is not easy
to understand how they could have been able to sustain protracted
and increasing famine for three months longer.<a id="FNanchor_340"
href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p>We make out little that is distinct respecting these last moments
of imperial Athens. We find only an heroic endurance displayed, to
such a point that numbers actually died of starvation, without<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span> any offer to surrender
on humiliating conditions.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341"
class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Amidst the general acrimony, and
exasperated special antipathies, arising out of such a state of
misery, the leading men who stood out most earnestly for prolonged
resistance became successively victims to the prosecutions of their
enemies. The demagogue Kleophon was condemned and put to death,
on the accusation of having evaded his military duty; the senate,
whose temper and proceedings he had denounced, constituting itself
a portion of the dikastery which tried him, contrary both to the
forms and the spirit of Athenian judicatures.<a id="FNanchor_342"
href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Such proceedings,
however, though denounced by orators in subsequent years as having
contributed to betray the city into the hands of the enemy, appear
to have been without any serious influence on the result, which was
brought about purely by famine.</p>

<p>By the time that Theramenês returned after his long absence, so
terrible had the pressure become, that he was sent forth again with
instructions to conclude peace upon any terms. On reaching Sellasia,
and acquainting the ephors that he had come with unlimited powers
for peace, he was permitted to come to Sparta, where the assembly
of the Peloponnesian confederacy was convened, to settle on what
terms peace should be granted. The leading allies, especially
Corinthians and Thebans, recommended that no agreement should be
entered into, nor any farther measure kept, with this hated enemy now
in their power; but that the name of Athens should be rooted out,
and the population sold for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p.
229]</span> slaves. Many of the other allies seconded the same views,
which would have probably commanded a majority, had it not been
for the resolute opposition of the Lacedæmonians themselves; who
declared unequivocally that they would never consent to annihilate
or enslave a city which had rendered such capital service to all
Greece at the time of the great common danger from the Persians.<a
id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
Lysander farther calculated on so dealing with Athens, as to make her
into a dependency, and an instrument of increased power to Sparta,
apart from her allies. Peace was accordingly granted on the following
conditions: that the Long Walls and the fortifications of the Peiræus
should be destroyed; that the Athenians should evacuate all their
foreign possessions, and confine themselves to their own territory;
that they should surrender all their ships of war; that they should
readmit all their exiles; that they should become allies of Sparta,
following her leadership both by sea and land, and recognizing the
same enemies and friends.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344"
class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>With this document, written according to Lacedæmonian
practice on a skytalê,—or roll intended to go round a stick, of
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> the
Lacedæmonian commander had always one, and the ephors another,
corresponding,—Theramenês went back to Athens. As he entered the
city, a miserable crowd flocked round him, in distress and terror
lest he should have failed altogether in his mission. The dead
and the dying had now become so numerous, that peace at any price
was a boon; nevertheless, when he announced in the assembly the
terms of which he was bearer, strongly recommending submission
to the Lacedæmonians as the only course now open, there was
still a high-spirited minority who entered their protest, and
preferred death by famine to such insupportable disgrace. The
large majority, however, accepted them, and the acceptance was
made known to Lysander.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345"
class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p>It was on the 16th day of the Attic month
Munychion,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346"
class="fnanchor">[346]</a>—about the middle or end of March,—that
this victorious commander sailed into the Peiræus, twenty-seven
years, almost exactly, after that surprise of Platæa by the
Thebans, which opened the Peloponnesian war. Along with him
came the Athenian exiles, several of whom appear to have been
serving with his army,<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347"
class="fnanchor">[347]</a> and assisting him with their counsel.
To the population of Athens generally, his entry was an immediate
relief, in spite of the cruel degradation, or indeed political
extinction, with which it was accompanied. At least it averted
the sufferings and horrors of famine, and permitted a decent
interment of the many unhappy victims who had already perished.
The Lacedæmonians, both naval and military force, under Lysander
and Agis, continued in occupation of Athens until the conditions
of the peace had been fulfilled. All the triremes in Peiræus were
carried away by Lysander, except twelve, which he permitted the
Athenians to retain: the ephors, in their skytalê, had left it to
his discretion what number he would thus allow.<a id="FNanchor_348"
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> The unfinished ships
in the dock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span>yards
were burnt, and the arsenals themselves ruined.<a id="FNanchor_349"
href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> To demolish the Long
Walls and the fortifications of Peiræus, was however, a work of some
time; and a certain number of days were granted to the Athenians,
within which it was required to be completed. In the beginning of
the work, the Lacedæmonians and their allies all lent a hand, with
the full pride and exultation of conquerors; amidst women playing
the flute and dancers crowned with wreaths; mingled with joyful
exclamations from the Peloponnesian allies, that this was the first
day of Grecian freedom.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350"
class="fnanchor">[350]</a> How many days were allowed for this
humiliating duty imposed upon Athenian hands, of demolishing the
elaborate, tutelary, and commanding works of their forefathers,
we are not told. But the business was not completed within the
interval named, so that the Athenians did not come up to the letter
of the conditions, and had therefore, by strict construction,
forfeited their title to the peace granted.<a id="FNanchor_351"
href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The interval seems,
however, to have been prolonged; probably considering that for the
real labor, as well as the melancholy character of the work to be
done, too short a time had been allowed at first.</p>

<p>It appears that Lysander, after assisting at the solemn ceremony
of beginning to demolish the walls, and making such a breach as
left Athens without any substantial means of resistance, did not
remain to complete the work, but withdrew with a portion of his
fleet to undertake the siege of Samos which still held out, leaving
the remainder to see that the conditions imposed were fulfilled.<a
id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>
After so long an endurance of extreme misery, doubtless the general
population thought of little except relief from famine and its
accompaniments, without any disposition to con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>tend against the fiat of their
conquerors. If some high-spirited men formed an exception to the
pervading depression, and still kept up their courage against
better days, there was at the same time a party of totally opposite
character, to whom the prostrate condition of Athens was a source
of revenge for the past, exultation for the present, and ambitious
projects for the future. These were partly the remnant of that
faction which had set up, seven years before, the oligarchy of Four
Hundred, and still more, the exiles, including several members
of the Four Hundred,<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353"
class="fnanchor">[353]</a> who now flocked in from all quarters.
Many of them had been long serving at Dekeleia, and had formed a
part of the force blockading Athens. These exiles now revisited the
acropolis as conquerors, and saw with delight the full accomplishment
of that foreign occupation at which many of them had aimed seven
years before, when they constructed the fortress of Ecteioneia, as
a means of insuring their own power. Though the conditions imposed
extinguished at once the imperial character, the maritime power, the
honor, and the independence of Athens, these men were as eager as
Lysander to carry them all into execution; because the continuance
of the Athenian democracy was now entirely at his mercy, and because
his establishment of oligarchies in the other subdued cities
plainly intimated what he would do in this great focus of Grecian
democratical impulse.</p>

<p>Among these exiles were comprised Aristodemus and Aristotelês,
both seemingly persons of importance, the former having at one
time been one of the Hellenotamiæ, the first financial office
of the imperial democracy, and the latter an active member of
the Four Hundred;<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354"
class="fnanchor">[354]</a> also Chariklês, who had been so
distinguished for his violence in the investigation respecting the
Hermæ, and another man, of whom we now for the first time obtain
historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span>
knowledge in detail, Kritias, son of Kallæschrus. He had been among
the persons accused as having been concerned in the mutilation of
the Hermæ, and seems to have been for a long time important in the
political, the literary, and the philosophical world of Athens.
To all three, his abilities qualified him to do honor. Both his
poetry, in the Solonian or moralizing vein, and his eloquence,
published specimens of which remained in the Augustan age, were of
no ordinary merit. His wealth was large, and his family among the
most ancient and conspicuous in Athens: one of his ancestors had
been friend and companion of the lawgiver Solon. He was himself
maternal uncle of the philosopher Plato,<a id="FNanchor_355"
href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and had frequented
the society of Sokratês so much as to have his name intimately
associated in the public mind with that remarkable man. We know
neither the cause, nor even the date of his exile, except so far,
as that he was not in banishment immediately after the revolution
of the Four Hundred, and that he <i>was</i> in banishment at the time
when the generals were condemned after the battle of Arginusæ.<a
id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>
He had passed the time, or a part of the time, of his exile in
Thessaly, where he took an active part in the sanguinary feuds
carried on among the oligarchical parties of that lawless country.
He is said to have embraced, along with a leader named, or surnamed,
Prometheus, what passed for the democratical side in Thessaly; arming
the penestæ, or serfs, against their masters.<a id="FNanchor_357"
href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> What the conduct and
dispositions of Kritias had been before this period we are unable to
say; but he brought with him now, on return<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span>ing from exile, not merely an unmeasured
and unprincipled lust of power, but also a rancorous impulse towards
spoliation and bloodshed<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358"
class="fnanchor">[358]</a> which outran even his ambition, and
ultimately ruined both his party and himself.</p>

<p>Of all these returning exiles, animated with mingled vengeance and
ambition, Kritias was decidedly the leading man, like Antiphon among
the Four Hundred; partly from his abilities, partly from the superior
violence with which he carried out the common sentiment. At the
present juncture, he and his fellow-exiles became the most important
persons in the city, as enjoying most the friendship and confidence
of the conquerors. But the oligarchical party at home were noway
behind them, either in servility or in revolutionary fervor, and an
understanding was soon established between the two. Probably the old
faction of the Four Hundred, though put down, had never wholly died
out: at any rate, the political hetæries, or clubs, out of which it
was composed, still remained, prepared for fresh coöperation when a
favorable moment should arrive; and the catastrophe of Ægospotami had
made it plain to every one that such moment could not be far distant.
Accordingly, a large portion, if not the majority, of the senators,
became ready to lend themselves to the destruction of the democracy,
and only anxious to insure places among the oligarchy in prospect;<a
id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
while the supple Theramenês—resuming his place as oligarchical
leader, and abusing his mission as envoy to wear out the patience of
his half-famished countrymen—had, during his three months’ absence
in the tent of Lysander, concerted arrangements with the exiles
for future proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360"
class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the city surrendered, and while the work of
demolition was yet going on, the oligarchical party began to
organize itself. The members of the political clubs again came
together, and named a managing committee of five, called ephors
in com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>pliment
to the Lacedæmonians, to direct the general proceedings of the
party; to convene meetings when needful, to appoint subordinate
managers for the various tribes, and to determine what propositions
were to be submitted to the public assembly.<a id="FNanchor_361"
href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Among these five
ephors were Kritias and Eratosthenês; probably Theramenês also.</p>

<p>But the oligarchical party, though thus organized and ascendant,
with a compliant senate and a dispirited people, and with an
auxiliary enemy actually in possession, still thought themselves not
powerful enough to carry their intended changes without seizing the
most resolute of the democratical leaders. Accordingly, a citizen
named Theokritus tendered an accusation to the senate against
the general Strombichidês, together with several others of the
democratical generals and taxiarchs; supported by the deposition of
a slave, or lowborn man, named Agoratus. Although Nikias and several
other citizens tried to prevail upon Agoratus to leave Athens,
furnished him with the means of escape, and offered to go away with
him themselves from Munychia, until the political state of Athens
should come into a more assured condition,<a id="FNanchor_362"
href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> yet he refused to
retire, appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>
before the senate, and accused the generals of being concerned in
a conspiracy to break up the peace; pretending to be himself their
accomplice. Upon his information, given both before the senate and
before an assembly at Munychia, the generals, the taxiarchs, and
several other citizens, men of high worth and courageous patriots,
were put into prison, as well as Agoratus himself, to stand their
trial afterwards before a dikastery consisting of two thousand
members. One of the parties thus accused, Menestratus, being admitted
by the public assembly, on the proposition of Hagnodôrus, the
brother-in-law of Kritias, to become accusing witness, named several
additional accomplices, who were also forthwith placed in custody.<a
id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Though the most determined defenders of the democratical
constitution were thus eliminated, Kritias and Theramenês still
farther insured the success of their propositions by invoking the
presence of Lysander from Samos. The demolition of the walls had
been completed, the main blockading army had disbanded, and the
immediate pressure of famine had been removed, when an assembly was
held to determine on future modifications of the constitution. A
citizen named Drakontidês,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364"
class="fnanchor">[364]</a> moved that a Board of Thirty should be
named, to draw up laws for the future government of the city, and
to manage provisionally the public affairs, until that task should
be completed. Among the thirty persons proposed, prearranged by
Theramenês and the oligarchical five ephors, the most prominent
names were those of Kritias and Theramenês: there were, besides,
Drakontidês himself,—Onomaklês, one of the Four Hundred who had
escaped,—Aristotelês and Chariklês, both exiles newly returned,
Eratosthenês,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span>
and others whom we do not know, but of whom probably several had
also been exiles or members of the Four Hundred.<a id="FNanchor_365"
href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Though this was
a complete abrogation of the constitution, yet so conscious were
the conspirators of their own strength, that they did not deem it
necessary to propose the formal suspension of the graphê paranomôn,
as had been done prior to the installation of the former oligarchy.
Still, notwithstanding the seizure of the leaders and the general
intimidation prevalent, a loud murmur of repugnance was heard in the
assembly at the motion of Drakontidês. But Theramenês rose up to
defy the murmur, telling the assembly that the proposition numbered
many partisans even among the citizens themselves, and that it had,
besides, the approbation of Lysander and the Lacedæmonians. This
was presently confirmed by Lysander himself, who addressed the
assembly in person. He told them, in a menacing and contemptuous
tone, that Athens was now at his mercy, since the walls had not
been demolished before the day specified, and consequently the
conditions of the promised peace had been violated. He added that,
if they did not adopt the recommendation of Theramenês, they would
be forced to take thought for their personal safety instead of
for their political constitution. After a notice at once so plain
and so crushing, farther resistance was vain. The dissentients
all quitted the assembly in sadness and indignation; while a
remnant—according to Lysias, inconsiderable in number as well as
worthless in character—stayed to vote acceptance of the motion.<a
id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>Seven years before, Theramenês had carried, in conjunction with
Antiphon and Phrynichus, a similar motion for the installation of
the Four Hundred; extorting acquiescence by domestic terrorism as
well as by multiplied assassinations. He now, in conjunction with
Kritias and the rest, a second time extinguished the constitution of
his country, by the still greater humiliation of a foreign conqueror
dictating terms to the Athenian people assembled in their own Pnyx.
Having seen the Thirty regularly constituted, Lysander retired from
Athens to finish the siege of Samos, which still held out. Though
blocked up both by land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p.
238]</span> and sea, the Samians obstinately defended themselves for
some months longer, until the close of the summer. Nor was it until
the last extremity that they capitulated; obtaining permission for
every freeman to depart in safety, but with no other property except
a single garment. Lysander handed over the city and the properties
to the ancient citizens, that is, to the oligarchy and their
partisans, who had been partly expelled, partly disfranchised, in the
revolution eight years before. But he placed the government of Samos,
as he had dealt with the other cities, in the hands of one of his
dekadarchies, or oligarchy of Ten Samians, chosen by himself; leaving
Thorax as Lacedæmonian harmost, and doubtless a force under him.<a
id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Having thus finished the war, and trodden out the last spark of
resistance, Lysander returned in triumph to Sparta. So imposing
a triumph never fell to the lot of any Greek, either before or
afterwards. He brought with him every trireme out of the harbor of
Peiræus, except twelve, left to the Athenians as a concession; he
brought the prow-ornaments of all the ships captured at Ægospotami
and elsewhere; he was loaded with golden crowns, voted to him by the
various cities; and he farther exhibited a sum of money not less than
four hundred and seventy talents, the remnant of those treasures
which Cyrus had handed over to him for the prosecution of the war.<a
id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>
That sum had been greater, but is said to have been diminished
by the treachery of Gylippus, to whose custody it had been
committed, and who sullied by such mean peculation the laurels
which he had so gloriously earned at Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_369"
href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Nor was it merely
the triumphant evidences of past exploits which now decorated this
returning admiral. He wielded besides an extent of real power greater
than any individual Greek either before or after. Imperial Sparta,
as she had now become, was as it were personified in Lysander, who
was master of almost all the insular, Asiatic, and Thracian cities,
by means of the harmost and the native dekadarchies named by himself
and selected from his creatures. To this state of things we shall
presently return, when we have followed the eventful history of the
Thirty at Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span></p>

<p>These thirty men—the parallel of the dekarchies whom Lysander had
constituted in the other cities—were intended for the same purpose,
to maintain the city in a state of humiliation and dependence upon
Lacedæmon, and upon Lysander, as the representative of Lacedæmon.
Though appointed, in the pretended view of drawing up a scheme of
laws and constitution for Athens, they were in no hurry to commence
this duty. They appointed a new senate, composed of compliant,
assured, and oligarchical persons; including many of the returned
exiles who had been formerly in the Four Hundred, and many also of
the preceding senators who were willing to serve their designs.<a
id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
They farther named new magistrates and officers; a new Board of
Eleven, to manage the business of police and the public force, with
Satyrus, one of their most violent partisans, as chief; a Board of
Ten, to govern in Peiræus;<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371"
class="fnanchor">[371]</a> an archon, to give name to the
year, Pythodôrus, and a second, or king-archon, Patroklês,<a
id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
to offer the customary sacrifices on behalf of the city. While thus
securing their own ascendency, and placing all power in the hands of
the most violent oligarchical partisans, they began by professing
reforming principles of the strictest virtue; denouncing the abuses
of the past democracy, and announcing their determination to purge
the city of evil-doers.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373"
class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The philosopher Plato—then a young man
about twenty-four years old, of anti-democratical politics, and
nephew of Kritias—was at first misled, together with various others,
by these splendid professions; he conceived hopes, and even received
encouragement from his relations, that he might play an active part
under the new oligarchy.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374"
class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Though he soon came to discern how little
congenial his feelings were with theirs, yet in the beginning
doubtless such honest illusions contributed materially to strengthen
their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span></p>

<p>In execution of their design to root out evil-doers, the Thirty
first laid hands on some of the most obnoxious politicians under
the former democracy; “men (says Xenophon) whom every one knew to
live by making calumnious accusations, called sycophancy, and who
were pronounced in their enmity to the oligarchical citizens.”
How far most of these men had been honest or dishonest in their
previous political conduct under the democracy, we have no means
of determining. But among them were comprised Strombichidês and
the other democratical officers who had been imprisoned under
the information of Agoratus, men whose chief crime consisted
in a strenuous and inflexible attachment to the democracy. The
persons thus seized were brought to trial before the new senate
appointed by the Thirty, contrary to the vote of the people, which
had decreed that Strombichidês and his companions should be tried
before a dikastery of two thousand citizens.<a id="FNanchor_375"
href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> But the dikastery, as
well as all the other democratical institutions, were now abrogated,
and no judicial body was left except the newly constituted senate.
Even to that senate, though composed of their own partisans, the
Thirty did not choose to intrust the trial of the prisoners, with
that secrecy of voting which was well known at Athens to be essential
to the free and genuine expression of sentiment. Whenever prisoners
were tried, the Thirty were themselves present in the senate-house,
sitting on the benches previously occupied by the prytanes: two
tables were placed before them, one signifying condemnation,
the other, acquittal; and each senator was required to deposit
his pebble openly before them, either on one or on the other.<a
id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> It
was not merely judgment by the senate, but judgment by the senate
under pressure and intimidation by the all-powerful Thirty. It seems
probable that neither any semblance of defence, nor any exculpatory
witnesses, were allowed; but even if such formalities were not wholly
dispensed with, it is certain that there was no real trial, and
that condemnation was assured beforehand. Among the great numbers
whom the Thirty brought before the senate, not a single man was
acquitted except the informer Agoratus, who was brought to trial as
an accomplice along with Strombichidês and his companions, but was
liberated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span> in
recompense for the information which he had given against them.<a
id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
The statement of Isokratês, Lysias, and others—that the victims
of the Thirty, even when brought before the senate, were put to
death untried—is authentic and trustworthy: many were even put
to death by simple order from the Thirty themselves, without any
cognizance of the senate.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378"
class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>In regard to the persons first brought to trial, however,—whether
we consider them, as Xenophon intimates, to have been notorious
evil-doers, or to have been innocent sufferers by the reactionary
vengeance of returning oligarchical exiles, as was the case certainly
with Strombichidês and the officers accused along with him,—there
was little necessity for any constraint on the part of the Thirty
over the senate. That body itself partook of the sentiment which
dictated the condemnation, and acted as a willing instrument;
while the Thirty themselves were unanimous, Theramenês being even
more zealous than Kritias in these executions, to demonstrate his
sincere antipathy towards the extinct democracy.<a id="FNanchor_379"
href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> As yet too, since
all the persons condemned, justly or unjustly, had been marked
politicians, so, all other citizens who had taken no conspicuous
part in politics, even if they disapproved of the condemnations,
had not been led to conceive any apprehension of the like fate for
themselves. Here, then, Theramenês, and along with him a portion of
the Thirty as well as of the senate, were inclined to pause. While
enough had been done to satiate their antipathies, by the death of
the most obnoxious leaders of the democracy, they at the same time
conceived the oligarchical government to be securely established, and
contended that farther bloodshed would only endanger its stability,
by spreading alarm, multiplying enemies, and alienating friends as
well as neutrals.</p>

<p>But these were not the views either of Kritias or of the Thirty
generally, who surveyed their position with eyes very different
from the unstable and cunning Theramenês, and who had brought<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> with them from exile
a long arrear of vengeance yet to be appeased. Kritias knew well
that the numerous population of Athens were devotedly attached,
and had good reason to be attached, to their democracy; that the
existing government had been imposed upon them by force, and could
only be upheld by force; that its friends were a narrow minority,
incapable of sustaining it against the multitude around them, all
armed; that there were still many formidable enemies to be got rid
of, so that it was indispensable to invoke the aid of a permanent
Lacedæmonian garrison in Athens, as the only condition not only of
their stability as a government, but even of their personal safety.
In spite of the opposition of Theramenês, Æschinês and Aristotelês,
two among the Thirty, were despatched to Sparta to solicit aid
from Lysander; who procured for them a Lacedæmonian garrison under
Kallibius as harmost, which they engaged to maintain without
any cost to Sparta, until their government should be confirmed
by putting the evil-doers out of the way.<a id="FNanchor_380"
href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Kallibius was not
only installed as master of the acropolis,—full as it was of the
mementos of Athenian glory,—but was farther so caressed and won
over by the Thirty, that he lent himself to everything which they
asked. They had thus a Lacedæmonian military force constantly at
their command, besides an organized band of youthful satellites
and assassins, ready for any deeds of violence; and they proceeded
to seize and put to death many citizens, who were so distinguished
for their courage and patriotism, as to be likely to serve as
leaders to the public discontent. Several of the best men in Athens
thus successively perished, while Thrasybulus, Anytus, and many
others, fearing a similar fate, fled out of Attica, leaving their
property to be confiscated and appropriated by the oligarchs;<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
who passed a decree of exile against them in their absence, as well
as against Alkibiadês.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382"
class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span></p>

<p>These successive acts of vengeance and violence were warmly
opposed by Theramenês, both in the council of Thirty and in the
senate. The persons hitherto executed, he said, had deserved their
death, because they were not merely noted politicians under the
democracy, but also persons of marked hostility to oligarchical
men. But to inflict the same fate on others, who had manifested no
such hostility, simply because they had enjoyed influence under the
democracy, would be unjust: “Even you and I (he reminded Kritias)
have both said and done many things for the sake of popularity.”
But Kritias replied: “We cannot afford to be scrupulous; we are
engaged in a scheme of aggressive ambition, and must get rid of
those who are best able to hinder us. Though we are Thirty in
number, and not one, our government is not the less a despotism,
and must be guarded by the same jealous precautions. If you think
otherwise, you must be simple-minded indeed.” Such were the
sentiments which animated the majority of the Thirty, not less than
Kritias, and which prompted them to an endless string of seizures
and executions. It was not merely the less obnoxious democratical
politicians who became their victims, but men of courage, wealth,
and station, in every vein of political feeling: even oligarchical
men, the best and most high-principled of that party, shared the
same fate. Among the most distinguished sufferers were, Lykurgus,<a
id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
belonging to one of the most eminent sacred gentes in the state;
a wealthy man named Antiphon, who had devoted his fortune to the
public service with exemplary patriotism during the last years of
the war, and had furnished two well-equipped triremes at his own
cost; Leon, of Salamis; and even Nikêratus, son of Nikias, who had
perished at Syracuse; a man who inherited from his father not only
a large fortune, but a known repugnance to democratical politics,
together with his uncle Eukratês, brother of the same Nikias.<a
id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
These were only a few among the numerous victims, who were seized,
pronounced to be guilty by the senate or by the Thirty themselves,
handed over to Satyrus and the Eleven, and condemned to perish by the
customary draught of hemlock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span></p>

<p>The circumstances accompanying the seizure of Leon deserve
particular notice. In putting to death him and the other victims,
the Thirty had several objects in view, all tending to the stability
of their dominion. First, they thus got rid of citizens generally
known and esteemed, whose abhorrence they knew themselves to
deserve, and whom they feared as likely to head the public sentiment
against them. Secondly, the property of these victims, all of whom
were rich, was seized along with their persons, and was employed
to pay the satellites whose agency was indispensable for such
violences, especially Kallibius and the Lacedæmonian hoplites in
the acropolis. But, besides murder and spoliation, the Thirty had
a farther purpose, if possible, yet more nefarious. In the work of
seizing their victims, they not only employed the hands of these paid
satellites, but also sent along with them citizens of station and
respectability, whom they constrained by threats and intimidation
to lend their personal aid in a service so thoroughly odious. By
such participation, these citizens became compromised and imbrued in
crime, and as it were, consenting parties in the public eye to all
the projects of the Thirty;<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385"
class="fnanchor">[385]</a> exposed to the same general hatred as
the latter, and interested for their own safety in maintaining the
existing dominion. Pursuant to their general plan of implicating
unwilling citizens in their misdeeds, the Thirty sent for five
citizens to the tholus, or government-house, and ordered them, with
terrible menaces, to cross over to Salamis and bring back Leon as
prisoner. Four out of the five obeyed; the fifth was the philosopher
Sokratês, who refused all concurrence and returned to his own
house, while the other four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p.
245]</span> went to Salamis and took part in the seizure of Leon.
Though he thus braved all the wrath of the Thirty, it appears that
they thought it expedient to leave him untouched. But the fact that
they singled him out for such an atrocity,—an old man of tried
virtue, both private and public, and intellectually commanding,
though at the same time intellectually unpopular,—shows to what an
extent they carried their system of forcing unwilling participants;
while the farther circumstance, that he was the only person who had
the courage to refuse, among four others who yielded to intimidation,
shows that the policy was for the most part successful.<a
id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
The inflexible resistance of Sokratês on this occasion, stands as a
worthy parallel to his conduct as prytanis in the public assembly
held on the conduct of the generals after the battle of Arginusæ,
described in the <a href="#Socrates">preceding chapter</a>, wherein
he obstinately refused to concur in putting an illegal question.</p>

<p>Such multiplied cases of execution and spoliation naturally
filled the city with surprise, indignation, and terror. Groups of
malcontents got together, and exiles became more and more numerous.
All these circumstances furnished ample material for the vehement
opposition of Theramenês, and tended to increase his party: not
indeed among the Thirty themselves, but to a certain extent in the
senate, and still more among the body of the citizens. He warned his
colleagues that they were incurring daily an increased amount of
public odium, and that their government could not possibly stand,
unless they admitted into partnership an adequate number of citizens,
with a direct interest in its maintenance. He proposed that all those
competent, by their property, to serve the state either on horseback
or with heavy armor, should be constituted citizens; leaving all
the poorer freemen, a far larger number, still disfranchised.<a
id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
Kritias and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span> the
Thirty rejected this proposition; being doubtless convinced—as the
Four Hundred had felt seven years before, when Theramenês demanded
of them to convert their fictitious total of Five Thousand into
a real list of as many living persons—that “to enroll so great a
number of partners, was tantamount to a downright democracy.”<a
id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
But they were at the same time not insensible to the soundness of
his advice: moreover, they began to be afraid of him personally,
and to suspect that he was likely to take the lead in a popular
opposition against them, as he had previously done against his
colleagues of the Four Hundred. They therefore resolved to comply in
part with his recommendations, and accordingly prepared a list of
three thousand persons to be invested with the political franchise;
chosen, as much as possible, from their own known partisans and
from oligarchical citizens. Besides this body, they also counted
on the adherence of the horsemen, among the wealthiest citizens of
the state. These horsemen, or knights, taking them as a class,—the
thousand good men of Athens, whose virtues Aristophanês sets
forth in hostile antithesis to the alleged demagogic vices of
Kleon,—remained steady supporters of the Thirty, throughout all the
enormities of their career.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389"
class="fnanchor">[389]</a> What privileges or functions were assigned
to the chosen three thousand, we do not hear, except that they could
not be condemned without the warrant of the senate, while any other
Athenian might be put to death by the simple fiat of the Thirty.<a
id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>A body of partners thus chosen—not merely of fixed number, but of
picked oligarchical sentiments—was by no means the addition which
Theramenês desired. While he commented on the folly of supposing that
there was any charm in the number three thousand, as if it embodied
all the merit of the city, and nothing else but merit, he admonished
them that it was still insufficient for their defence; their rule was
one of pure force, and yet inferior in force to those over whom it
was exercised. Again the Thirty acted upon his admonition, but in a
way very different from that which he contemplated. They proclaimed
a general muster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span>
and examination of arms to all the hoplites in Athens. The Three
Thousand were drawn up in arms all together in the market-place; but
the remaining hoplites were disseminated in small scattered companies
and in different places. After the review was over, these scattered
companies went home to their meal, leaving their arms piled at the
various places of muster. But the adherents of the Thirty, having
been forewarned and kept together, were sent at the proper moment,
along with the Lacedæmonian mercenaries, to seize the deserted
arms, which were deposited under the custody of Kallibius in the
acropolis. All the hoplites in Athens, except the Three Thousand and
the remaining adherents of the Thirty, were disarmed by this crafty
manœuvre, in spite of the fruitless remonstrance of Theramenês.<a
id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>Kritias and his colleagues, now relieved from all fear either
of Theramenês, or of any other internal opposition, gave loose,
more unsparingly than ever, to their malevolence and rapacity,
putting to death both many of their private enemies, and many
rich victims for the purpose of spoliation. A list of suspected
persons was drawn up, in which each of their adherents was allowed
to insert such names as he chose, and from which the victims
were generally taken.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Among informers, who thus gave in names
for destruction, Batrachus and Æschylidês<a id="FNanchor_393"
href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> stood conspicuous.
The thirst of Kritias for plunder, as well as for bloodshed, only
increased by gratification;<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394"
class="fnanchor">[394]</a> and it was not merely to pay their
mercenaries, but also to enrich themselves separately, that the
Thirty stretched everywhere their murderous agency, which now
mowed down metics as well as citizens. Theognis and Peison, two of
the Thirty, affirmed that many of these metics were hostile<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> to the oligarchy,
besides being opulent men; and the resolution was adopted that each
of the rulers should single out any of these victims that he pleased,
for execution and pillage; care being taken to include a few poor
persons in the seizure, so that the real purpose of the spoilers
might be faintly disguised.</p>

<p>It was in execution of this scheme that the orator Lysias and his
brother Polemarchus were both taken into custody. Both were metics,
wealthy men, and engaged in a manufactory of shields, wherein they
employed a hundred and twenty slaves. Theognis and Peison, with
some others, seized Lysias in his house, while entertaining some
friends at dinner; and having driven away his guests, left him under
the guard of Peison, while the attendants went off to register and
appropriate his valuable slaves. Lysias tried to prevail on Peison
to accept a bribe and let him escape; which the latter at first
promised to do, and having thus obtained access to the money-chest
of the prisoner, laid hands upon all its contents, amounting to
between three and four talents. In vain did Lysias implore that a
trifle might be left for his necessary subsistence; the only answer
vouchsafed was, that he might think himself fortunate if he escaped
with life. He was then conveyed to the house of a person named
Damnippus, where Theognis already was, having other prisoners in
charge. At the earnest entreaty of Lysias, Damnippus tried to induce
Theognis to connive at his escape, on consideration of a handsome
bribe; but while this conversation was going on, the prisoner availed
himself of an unguarded moment to get off through the back door,
which fortunately was open, together with two other doors through
which it was necessary to pass. Having first obtained refuge in the
house of a friend in Peiræus, he took boat during the ensuing night
for Megara. Polemarchus, less fortunate, was seized in the street
by Eratosthenês, one of the Thirty, and immediately lodged in the
prison, where the fatal draught of hemlock was administered to him,
without delay, without trial, and without liberty of defence. While
his house was plundered of a large stock of gold, silver, furniture,
and rich ornaments; while the golden earrings were torn from the
ears of his wife; and while seven hundred shields, with a hundred
and twenty slaves, were confiscated, together with the workshop and
the two dwelling-houses; the Thirty would not allow even a decent
funeral to the deceased, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p.
249]</span> caused his body to be carried away on a hired bier
from the prison, with covering and a few scanty appurtenances
supplied by the sympathy of private friends.<a id="FNanchor_395"
href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>Amidst such atrocities, increasing in number and turned more and
more to shameless robbery, the party of Theramenês daily gained
ground, even in the senate; many of whose members profited nothing
by satiating the private cupidity of the Thirty, and began to be
weary of so revolting a system, as well as alarmed at the host of
enemies which they were raising up. In proposing the late seizure
of the metics, the Thirty had desired Theramenês to make choice of
any victim among that class, to be destroyed and plundered for his
own personal benefit. But he rejected the suggestion emphatically,
denouncing the enormity of the measure in the indignant terms which
it deserved. So much was the antipathy of Kritias and the majority
of the Thirty against him, already acrimonious from the effects of a
long course of opposition, exasperated by this refusal; so much did
they fear the consequences of incurring the obloquy of such measures
for themselves, while Theramenês enjoyed all the credit of opposing
them; so satisfied were they that their government could not stand
with this dissension among its own members; that they resolved to
destroy him at all cost. Having canvassed as many of the senators as
they could, to persuade them that Theramenês was conspiring against
the oligarchy, they caused the most daring of their satellites to
attend one day in the senate-house, close to the railing which fenced
in the senators, with daggers concealed under their garments. So
soon as Theramenês appeared, Kritias rose and denounced him to the
senate as a public enemy, in an harangue which Xenophon gives at
considerable length, and which is so full of instructive evidence, as
to Greek political feeling, that I here extract the main points in
abridgment:—</p>

<p>“If any of you imagine, senators, that more people are perishing
than the occasion requires, reflect, that this happens everywhere in
a time of revolution, and that it must especially happen in the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> establishment of an
oligarchy at Athens, the most populous city in Greece, and where
the population has been longest accustomed to freedom. You know
as well as we do, that democracy is to both of us an intolerable
government, as well as incompatible with all steady adherence to our
protectors, the Lacedæmonians. It is under their auspices that we are
establishing the present oligarchy, and that we destroy, as far as we
can, every man who stands in the way of it; which becomes most of all
indispensable, if such a man be found among our own body. Here stands
the man, Theramenês, whom we now denounce to you as your foe not
less than ours. That such is the fact, is plain from his unmeasured
censures on our proceedings, from the difficulties which he throws
in our way whenever we want to despatch any of the demagogues. Had
such been his policy from the beginning, he would indeed have been
our enemy, yet we could not with justice have proclaimed him a
villain. But it is he who first originated the alliance which binds
us to Sparta, who struck the first blow at the democracy, who chiefly
instigated us to put to death the first batch of accused persons; and
now, when you as well as we have thus incurred the manifest hatred of
the people, he turns round and quarrels with our proceedings in order
to insure his own safety, and leave us to pay the penalty. He must
be dealt with not only as an enemy, but as a traitor, to you as well
as to us; a traitor in the grain, as his whole life proves. Though
he enjoyed, through his father Agnon, a station of honor under the
democracy, he was foremost in subverting it, and setting up the Four
Hundred; the moment he saw that oligarchy beset with difficulties, he
was the first to put himself at the head of the people against them;
always ready for change in both directions, and a willing accomplice
in those executions which changes of government bring with them. It
is he, too, who—having been ordered by the generals after the battle
of Arginusæ to pick up the men on the disabled ships, and having
neglected the task—accused and brought to execution his superiors, in
order to get himself out of danger. He has well earned his surname of
The Buskin, fitting both legs, but constant to neither; he has shown
himself reckless both of honor and friendship, looking to nothing but
his own selfish advancement; and it is for us now to guard against
his doublings, in order that he may not play us the same<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span> trick. We cite him
before you as a conspirator and a traitor, against you as well as
against us. Look to your own safety, and not to his. For depend upon
it, that if you let him off, you will hold out powerful encouragement
to your worst enemies; while if you condemn him, you will crush their
best hopes, both within and without the city.”</p>

<p>Theramenês was probably not wholly unprepared for some such attack
as this. At any rate, he rose up to reply to it at once:—</p>

<p>“First of all, senators, I shall touch upon the charge against
me which Kritias mentioned last, the charge of having accused and
brought to execution the generals. It was not I who began the
accusation against them, but they who began it against me. They said,
that they had ordered me upon the duty, and that I had neglected it;
my defence was, that the duty could not be executed, in consequence
of the storm; the people believed and exonerated me, but the generals
were rightfully condemned on their own accusation, because <i>they</i>
said that the duty might have been performed, while yet it had
remained unperformed. I do not wonder, indeed, that Kritias has
told these falsehoods against me; for at the time when this affair
happened, he was an exile in Thessaly, employed in raising up a
democracy, and arming the penestæ against their masters. Heaven grant
that nothing of what he perpetrated <i>there</i> may occur at Athens! I
agree with Kritias, indeed, that, whoever wishes to cut short your
government, and strengthens those who conspire against you, deserves
justly the severest punishment. But to whom does this charge best
apply? To him, or to me? Look at the behavior of each of us, and
then judge for yourselves. At first, we were all agreed, so far as
the condemnation of the known and obnoxious demagogues. But when
Kritias and his friends began to seize men of station and dignity,
then it was that I began to oppose them. I knew that the seizure
of men like Leon, Nikias, and Antiphon, would make the best men in
the city your enemies. I opposed the execution of the metics, well
aware that all that body would be alienated. I opposed the disarming
of the citizens, and the hiring of foreign guards. And when I saw
that enemies at home and exiles abroad were multiplying against
you, I dissuaded you from banishing Thrasybulus and Anytus, whereby
you only furnished the exiles with compe<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span>tent leaders. The man who gives you this
advice, and gives it you openly, is he a traitor, or is he not rather
a genuine friend? It is you and your supporters, Kritias, who, by
your murders and robberies, strengthen the enemies of the government
and betray your friends. Depend upon it, that Thrasybulus and Anytus
are much better pleased with your policy than they would be with
mine. You accuse me of having betrayed the Four Hundred; but I did
not desert them until they were themselves on the point of betraying
Athens to her enemies. You call me The Buskin, as trying to fit both
parties. But what am I to call <i>you</i>, who fit neither of them? who,
under the democracy, were the most violent hater of the people, and
who, under the oligarchy, have become equally violent as a hater of
oligarchical merit? I am, and always have been, Kritias, an enemy
both to extreme democracy and to oligarchical tyranny. I desire to
constitute our political community out of those who can serve it on
horseback and with heavy armor; I have proposed this once, and I
still stand to it. I side not either with democrats or despots, to
the exclusion of the dignified citizens. Prove that I am now, or ever
have been, guilty of such crime, and I shall confess myself deserving
of ignominious death.”</p>

<p>This reply of Theramenês was received with such a shout of
applause by the majority of the senate, as showed that they were
resolved to acquit him. To the fierce antipathies of the mortified
Kritias, the idea of failure was intolerable; indeed, he had now
carried his hostility to such a point, that the acquittal of his
enemy would have been his own ruin. After exchanging a few words with
the Thirty, he retired for a few moments, and directed the Eleven
with the body of armed satellites to press close on the railing
whereby the senators were fenced round,—while the court before the
senate-house was filled with the mercenary hoplites. Having thus got
his force in hand, Kritias returned and again addressed the senate:
“Senators (said he), I think it the duty of a good president, when
he sees his friends around him duped, not to let them follow their
own counsel. This is what I am now going to do; indeed, these men,
whom you see pressing upon us from without, tell us plainly that they
will not tolerate the acquittal of one manifestly working to the ruin
of the oligarchy. It is an article of our new constitution, that
no man of the select Three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p.
253]</span> Thousand shall be condemned without your vote; but that
any man not included in that list may be condemned by the Thirty. Now
I take upon me, with the concurrence of all my colleagues, to strike
this Theramenês out of that list; and we, by our authority, condemn
him to death.”</p>

<p>Though Theramenês had already been twice concerned in putting
down the democracy, yet such was the habit of all Athenians to look
for protection from constitutional forms, that he probably accounted
himself safe under the favorable verdict of the senate, and was not
prepared for the monstrous and despotic sentence which he now heard
from his enemy. He sprang at once to the senatorial hearth,—the altar
and sanctuary in the interior of the senate-house,—and exclaimed: “I
too, senators, stand as your suppliant, asking only for bare justice.
Let it be not in the power of Kritias to strike out me or any other
man whom he chooses; let my sentence as well as yours be passed
according to the law which these Thirty have themselves prepared. I
know but too well, that this altar will be of no avail to me as a
defence; but I shall at least make it plain, that these men are as
impious towards the gods as they are nefarious towards men. As for
you, worthy senators, I wonder that you will not stand forward for
your own personal safety; since you must be well aware, that your
own names may be struck out of the Three Thousand just as easily as
mine.”</p>

<p>But the senate remained passive and stupefied by fear, in spite
of these moving words, which perhaps were not perfectly heard, since
it could not be the design of Kritias to permit his enemy to speak
a second time. It was probably while Theramenês was yet speaking,
that the loud voice of the herald was heard, calling the Eleven to
come forward and take him into custody. The Eleven advanced into the
senate, headed by their brutal chief Satyrus, and followed by their
usual attendants. They went straight up to the altar, from whence
Satyrus, aided by the attendants, dragged him by main force, while
Kritias said to them: “We hand over to you this man Theramenês,
condemned according to the law. Seize him, carry him off to prison,
and there do the needful.” Upon this, Theramenês was dragged out of
the senate-house and carried in custody through the market-place,
exclaiming with a loud voice against the atrocious treatment<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span> which he was suffering.
“Hold your tongue (said Satyrus to him), or you will suffer for it.”
“And if I <i>do</i> hold my tongue (replied Theramenês), shall not I
suffer for it also?”</p>

<p>He was conveyed to prison, where the usual draught of hemlock
was speedily administered. After he had swallowed it, there
remained a drop at the bottom of the cup, which he jerked out on
the floor (according to the playful convivial practice called the
Kottabus, which was supposed to furnish an omen by its sound in
falling, and after which the person who had just drank handed the
goblet to the guest whose turn came next): “Let this (said he) be
for the gentle Kritias.”<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396"
class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>The scene just described, which ended in the execution of
Theramenês, is one of the most striking and tragical in ancient
history; in spite of the bald and meagre way in which it is recounted
by Xenophon, who has thrown all the interest into the two speeches.
The atrocious injustice by which Theramenês perished, as well as
the courage and self-possession which he displayed at the moment
of danger, and his cheerfulness even in the prison, not inferior
to that of Sokratês three years afterwards, naturally enlist the
warmest sympathies of the reader in his favor, and have tended
to exalt the positive estimation of his character. During the
years immediately succeeding the restoration of the democracy,<a
id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> he
was extolled and pitied as one of the first martyrs to oligarchical
violence: later authors went so far as to number him among the
chosen pupils of Sokratês.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398"
class="fnanchor">[398]</a> But<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span> though Theramenês here became the
victim of a much worse man than himself, it will not for that reason
be proper to accord to him our admiration, which his own conduct will
not at all be found to deserve. The reproaches of Kritias against
him, founded on his conduct during the previous conspiracy of the
Four Hundred, were in the main well founded. After having been one
of the foremost originators of that conspiracy, he deserted his
comrades as soon as he saw that it was likely to fail; and Kritias
had doubtless present to his mind the fate of Antiphon, who had been
condemned and executed under the accusation of Theramenês, together
with a reasonable conviction that the latter would again turn against
his colleagues in the same manner, if circumstances should encourage
him to do so. Nor was Kritias wrong in denouncing the perfidy of
Theramenês with regard to the generals after the battle of Arginusæ,
the death of whom he was partly instrumental in bringing about,
though only as an auxiliary cause, and not with that extreme stretch
of nefarious stratagem, which Xenophon and others have imputed to
him. He was a selfish, cunning, and faithless man,—ready to enter
into conspiracies, yet never foreseeing their consequences,—and
breaking faith to the ruin of colleagues whom he had first
encouraged, when he found them more consistent and thoroughgoing
in crime than himself.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399"
class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Such high-handed violence, by Kritias and the majority of
the Thirty,—carried though, even against a member of their own
Board, by intimidation of the senate,—left a feeling of disgust
and dissension among their own partisans from which their power
never recovered. Its immediate effect, however, was to render
them, apparently, and in their own estimation, more powerful than
ever. All open manifestation of dissent being now silenced, they
proceeded to the uttermost limits of cruel and licentious tyranny.
They made proclamation, that every one not included in the list of
Three Thousand, should depart without the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span> walls, in order that they might be
undisturbed masters within the city, a policy before resorted to by
Periander of Corinth and other Grecian despots.<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> The numerous
fugitives expelled by this order, distributed themselves partly
in Peiræus, partly in the various demes of Attica. Both in one
and the other, however, they were seized by order of the Thirty,
and many of them put to death, in order that their substance and
lands might be appropriated either by the Thirty themselves, or by
some favored partisan.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401"
class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The denunciations of Batrachus,
Æschylidês, and other delators, became more numerous than ever, in
order to obtain the seizure and execution of their private enemies;
and the oligarchy were willing to purchase any new adherent by thus
gratifying his antipathies or his rapacity.<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> The subsequent
orators affirmed that more than fifteen hundred victims were
put to death without trial by the Thirty;<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> on this numerical
estimate little stress is to be laid, but the total was doubtless
prodigious. It became more and more plain that no man was safe
in Attica; so that Athenian emigrants, many in great poverty
and destitution, were multiplied throughout the neighboring
territories,—in Megara, Thebes, Orôpus, Chalkis, Argos, etc.<a
id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
It was not everywhere that these distressed persons could obtain
reception; for the Lacedæmonian government, at the instance of
the Thirty, issued an edict prohibiting all the members of their
confederacy from harboring fugitive Athenians; an edict which these
cities generously disobeyed,<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405"
class="fnanchor">[405]</a> though probably the smaller Peloponnesian
cities complied. Without doubt, this decree was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> procured by Lysander, while his
influence still continued unimpaired.</p>

<p>But it was not only against the lives, properties, and liberties
of Athenian citizens that the Thirty made war. They were not less
solicitous to extinguish the intellectual force and education of
the city; a project so perfectly in harmony both with the sentiment
and practice of Sparta, that they counted on the support of their
foreign allies. Among the ordinances which they promulgated
was one, expressly forbidding every one<a id="FNanchor_406"
href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> “to teach the art
of words,” if I may be allowed to translate literally the Greek
expression, which bore a most comprehensive signification, and
denoted every intentional communication of logical, rhetorical, or
argumentative improvement,—of literary criticism and composition,—and
of command over those political and moral topics which formed the
ordinary theme of discussion. Such was the species of instruction
which Sokratês and other sophists, each in his own way, communicated
to the Athenian youth. The great foreign sophists, not Athenian, such
as Prodikus and Protagoras had been,—though perhaps neither of these
two was now alive,—were doubtless no longer in the city, under the
calamitous circumstances which had been weighing upon every citizen
since the defeat of Ægospotami. But there were abundance of native
teachers, or sophists, inferior in merit to these distinguished
names, yet still habitually employed, with more or less success,
in communicating a species of instruction held indispensable to
every liberal Athenian. The edict of the Thirty was in fact a
general suppression of the higher class<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span> of teachers or professors, above the
rank of the elementary teacher of letters, or grammatist. If such
an edict could have been maintained in force for a generation,
combined with the other mandates of the Thirty, the city out of
which Sophoklês and Euripidês had just died, and in which Plato and
Isokratês were in vigorous age, the former twenty-five, the latter
twenty-nine, would have been degraded to the intellectual level of
the meanest community in Greece. It was not uncommon for a Grecian
despot to suppress all those assemblies wherein youths came together
for the purpose of common training, either intellectual or gymnastic;
as well as the public banquets and clubs, or associations, as being
dangerous to his authority, and tending to elevation of courage,
and to a consciousness of political rights among the citizens.<a
id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>The enormities of the Thirty had provoked severe comments from
the philosopher Sokratês, whose life was spent in conversation on
instructive subjects with those young men who sought his society,
though he never took money from any pupil. These comments had been
made known to Kritias and Chariklês, who sent for him, reminded him
of the prohibitive law, and peremptorily commanded him to abstain for
the future from all conversation with youths. Sokratês met this order
by putting some questions to those who gave it, in his usual style of
puzzling scrutiny, destined to expose the vagueness of the terms; and
to draw the line, or rather to show that no definite line could be
drawn, between that which was permitted and that which was forbidden.
But he soon perceived that his interrogations produced only a feeling
of disgust and wrath, menacing to his own safety. The tyrants
ended by repeating their interdict in yet more peremptory terms,
and by giving Sokratês to understand, that they were not ignorant
of the censures which he had cast upon them.<a id="FNanchor_408"
href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>Though our evidence does not enable us to make out the precise
dates of these various oppressions of the Thirty, yet it seems
probable that this prohibition of teaching must have been among their
earlier enactments; at any rate, considerably anterior to the death
of Theramenês, and the general expulsion out of the walls of all
except the privileged Three Thousand. Their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span> dominion continued, without any armed
opposition made to it, for about eight months from the capture
of Athens by Lysander, that is, from about April to December 404
<small>B.C.</small> The measure of their iniquity then became full.
They had accumulated against themselves, both in Attica and among the
exiles in the circumjacent territories, suffering and exasperated
enemies, while they had lost the sympathy of Thebes, Megara, and
Corinth, and were less heartily supported by Sparta.</p>

<p>During these important eight months, the general feeling
throughout Greece had become materially different both towards
Athens and towards Sparta. At the moment when the long war was first
brought to a close, fear, antipathy, and vengeance against Athens,
had been the reigning sentiment, both among the confederates of
Sparta and among the revolted members of the extinct Athenian empire;
a sentiment which prevailed among them indeed to a greater degree
than among the Spartans themselves, who resisted it, and granted to
Athens a capitulation at a time when many of their allies pressed
for the harshest measures. To this resolution they were determined
partly by the still remaining force of ancient sympathy; partly by
the odium which would have been sure to follow the act of expelling
the Athenian population, however it might be talked of beforehand
as a meet punishment; partly too by the policy of Lysander, who
contemplated the keeping of Athens in the same dependence on Sparta
and on himself, and by the same means, as the other outlying cities
in which he had planted his dekadarchies.</p>

<p>So soon as Athens was humbled, deprived of her fleet and walled
port, and rendered innocuous, the great bond of common fear which
had held the allies to Sparta disappeared; and while the paramount
antipathy on the part of those allies towards Athens gradually died
away, a sentiment of jealousy and apprehension of Sparta sprang up in
its place, on the part of the leading states among them. For such a
sentiment there was more than one reason. Lysander had brought home
not only a large sum of money, but valuable spoils of other kinds,
and many captive triremes, at the close of the war. As the success
had been achieved by the joint exertions of all the allies, so the
fruits of it belonged in equity to all of them jointly, not to Sparta
alone. The Thebans and Corinthians preferred a formal claim to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span> be allowed to share;
and if the other allies abstained from openly backing the demand, we
may fairly presume that it was not from any different construction
of the equity of the case, but from fear of offending Sparta. In
the testimonial erected by Lysander at Delphi, commemorative of
the triumph, he had included not only his own brazen statue, but
that of each commander of the allied contingents; thus formally
admitting the allies to share in the honorary results, and tacitly
sanctioning their claim to the lucrative results also. Nevertheless,
the demand made by the Thebans and Corinthians was not only repelled,
but almost resented as an insult; especially by Lysander, whose
influence was at that moment almost omnipotent.<a id="FNanchor_409"
href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>That the Lacedæmonians should have withheld from the allies a
share in this money, demonstrates still more the great ascendency of
Lysander; because there was a considerable party at Sparta itself,
who protested altogether against the reception of so much gold and
silver, as contrary to the ordinances of Lykurgus, and fatal to
the peculiar morality of Sparta. An ancient Spartan, Skiraphidas,
or Phlogidas, took the lead in calling for exclusive adherence to
the old Spartan money, heavy iron, difficult to carry; nor was it
without difficulty that Lysander and his friends obtained admission
for the treasure into Sparta; under special proviso, that it should
be for the exclusive purposes of the government, and that no private
citizen should ever circulate gold or silver.<a id="FNanchor_410"
href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The existence of
such traditionary repugnance among the Spartans would have seemed
likely to induce them to be just towards their allies, since an
equitable distribution of the treasure would have gone far to remove
the difficulty; yet they nevertheless kept it all.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span></p> <p>But besides
this special offence given to the allies, the conduct of Sparta
in other ways showed that she intended to turn the victory to her
own account. Lysander was at this moment all-powerful, playing his
own game under the name of Sparta. His position was far greater
than that of the regent Pausanias had been after the victory of
Platæa; and his talents for making use of the position incomparably
superior. The magnitude of his successes, as well as the eminent
ability which he had displayed, justified abundant eulogy; but in
his case, the eulogy was carried to the length of something like
worship. Altars were erected to him; pæans or hymns were composed in
his honor; the Ephesians set up his statue in the temple of their
goddess Artemis; and the Samians not only erected a statue to him
at Olympia, but even altered the name of their great festival, the
Heræa, to <i>Lysandria</i>.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411"
class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Several contemporary poets—Antilochus,
Chœrilus, Nikêratus, and Antimachus—devoted themselves to sing his
glories and profit by his rewards.</p>

<p>Such excess of flattery was calculated to turn the head even
of the most virtuous Greek: with Lysander, it had the effect of
substituting, in place of that assumed smoothness of manner with
which he began his command, an insulting harshness and arrogance
corresponding to the really unmeasured ambition which he cherished.<a
id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
His ambition prompted him to aggrandize Sparta separately, without
any thought of her allies, in order to exercise dominion in her
name. He had already established dekadarchies, or oligarchies of
Ten, in many of the insular and Asiatic cities, and an oligarchy
of Thirty in Athens; all composed of vehement partisans chosen
by himself, dependent upon him for support, and devoted to his
objects. To the eye of an impartial observer in Greece, it seemed
as if all these cities had been converted into dependencies
of Sparta, and were intended to be held in that condition;
under Spartan authority, exercised by and through Lysander.<a
id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
Instead of that general freedom which had been<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> promised as an incentive to revolt
against Athens, a Spartan empire had been constituted in place
of the extinct Athenian, with a tribute, amounting to a thousand
talents annually, intended to be assessed upon the component
cities and islands.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414"
class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Such at least was the scheme of Lysander,
though it never reached complete execution.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that under such a state of feeling on the
part of the allies of Sparta, the enormities perpetrated by the
Thirty at Athens and by the Lysandrian dekadarchies in the other
cities, would be heard with sympathy for the sufferers, and without
that strong anti-Athenian sentiment which had reigned a few months
before. But what was of still greater importance, even at Sparta
itself, opposition began to spring up against the measures and the
person of Lysander. If the leading men at Sparta had felt jealous
even of Brasidas, who offended them only by unparalleled success
and merit as a commander,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> much more would the same feeling be
aroused against Lysander, who displayed an overweening insolence,
and was worshipped with an ostentatious flattery, not inferior to
that of Pausanias after the battle of Platæa. Another Pausanias, son
of Pleistoanax, was now king of Sparta, in conjunction with Agis.
Upon him the feeling of jealousy against Lysander told with especial
force, as it did afterwards upon Agesilaus, the successor of Agis;
not unaccompanied probably with suspicion, which subsequent events
justified, that Lysander was aiming at some interference with the
regal privileges. Nor is it unfair to suppose that Pausanias was
animated by motives more patriotic than mere jealousy, and that the
rapacious cruelty, which everywhere dishonored the new oligarchies,
both shocked his better feelings and inspired him with fears for
the stability of the system. A farther circumstance which weakened
the influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>
of Lysander at Sparta was the annual change of ephors, which took
place about the end of September or beginning of October. Those
ephors under whom his grand success and the capture of Athens had
been consummated, and who had lent themselves entirely to his views,
passed out of office in September 404 <small>B.C.</small>, and gave
place to others more disposed to second Pausanias.</p>

<p>I remarked, in the <a href="#Kalli">preceding chapter</a>, how
much more honorable for Sparta, and how much less unfortunate for
Athens and for the rest of Greece, the close of the Peloponnesian war
would have been, if Kallikratidas had gained and survived the battle
of Arginusæ, so as to close it then, and to acquire for himself
that personal ascendency which the victorious general was sure to
exercise over the numerous rearrangements consequent on peace. We
see how important the personal character of the general so placed
was, when we follow the proceedings of Lysander during the year
after the battle of Ægospotami. His personal views were the grand
determining circumstance throughout Greece; regulating both the
measures of Sparta, and the fate of the conquered cities. Throughout
the latter, rapacious and cruel oligarchies were organized,—of Ten
in most cities, but of Thirty in Athens,—all acting under the power
and protection of Sparta, but in real subordination to his ambition.
Because he happened to be under the influence of a selfish thirst
for power, the measures of Sparta were divested not merely of all
Pan-Hellenic spirit, but even, to a great degree, of reference to
her own confederates, and concentrated upon the acquisition of
imperial preponderance for herself. Now if Kallikratidas had been
the ascendent person at this critical juncture, not only such narrow
and baneful impulses would have been comparatively inoperative,
but the leading state would have been made to set the example
of recommending, of organizing, and if necessary, of enforcing
arrangements favorable to Pan-Hellenic brotherhood. Kallikratidas
would not only have refused to lend himself to dekadarchies governing
by his force and for his purposes, in the subordinate cities, but
he would have discountenanced such conspiracies, wherever they
tended to arise spontaneously. No ruffian like Kritias, no crafty
schemer like Theramenês, would have reckoned upon his aid as they
presumed upon the friendship of Lysander. Probably he would have
left the government of each city to its<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span> own natural tendencies, oligarchical
or democratical; interfering only in special cases of actual and
pronounced necessity. Now the influence of an ascendent state,
employed for such purposes, and emphatically discarding all private
ends for the accomplishment of a stable Pan-Hellenic sentiment and
fraternity; employed too thus, at a moment when so many of the Greek
towns were in the throes of reorganization, having to take up a new
political course in reference to the altered circumstances, is an
element of which the force could hardly have failed to be prodigious
as well as beneficial. What degree of positive good might have been
wrought, by a noble-minded victor under such special circumstances,
we cannot presume to affirm in detail. But it would have been no
mean advantage, to have preserved Greece from beholding and feeling
such enormous powers in the hands of a man like Lysander; through
whose management the worst tendencies of an imperial city were
studiously magnified by the exorbitance of individual ambition.
It was to him exclusively that the Thirty in Athens, and the
dekadarchies elsewhere, owed both their existence and their means of
oppression.</p>

<p>It has been necessary thus to explain the general changes which
had gone on in Greece and in Grecian feeling during the eight months
succeeding the capture of Athens in March 404 <small>B.C.</small>, in
order that we may understand the position of the Thirty oligarchs,
or Tyrants, at Athens, and of the Athenian population both in Attica
and in exile, about the beginning of December in the same year, the
period which we have now reached. We see how it was that Thebes,
Corinth, and Megara, who in March had been the bitterest enemies of
the Athenians, had now become alienated both from Sparta and from
the Lysandrian Thirty, whom they viewed as viceroys of Athens for
separate Spartan benefit. We see how the basis was thus laid of
sympathy for the suffering exiles who fled from Attica; a feeling
which the recital of the endless enormities perpetrated by Kritias
and his colleagues inflamed every day more and more. We discern at
the same time how the Thirty, while thus incurring enmity both in
and out of Attica, were at the same time losing the hearty support
of Sparta, from the decline of Lysander’s influence, and the growing
opposition of his rivals at home.</p>

<p>In spite of formal prohibition from Sparta, obtained
doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> under
the influence of Lysander, the Athenian emigrants had obtained
shelter in all the states bordering on Attica. It was from Bœotia
that they struck the first blow. Thrasybulus, Anytus, and Archinus,
starting from Thebes with the sympathy of the Theban public, and with
substantial aid from Ismenias and other wealthy citizens,—at the
head of a small band of exiles stated variously at thirty, sixty,
seventy, or somewhat above one hundred men,<a id="FNanchor_416"
href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>—seized Phylê,
a frontier fortress in the mountains north of Attica, lying on
the direct road between Athens and Thebes. Probably it had no
garrison; for the Thirty, acting in the interest of Lacedæmonian
predominance, had dismantled all the outlying fortresses in Attica;<a
id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
so that Thrasybulus accomplished his purpose without resistance.
The Thirty marched out from Athens to attack him, at the head of
a powerful force, comprising the Lacedæmonian hoplites who formed
their guard, the Three Thousand privileged citizens, and all the
knights, or horsemen. Probably the small company of Thrasybulus was
reinforced by fresh accessions of exiles, as soon as he was known to
have occupied the fort. For by the time that the Thirty with their
assailing force arrived, he was in condition to repel a vigorous
assault made by the younger soldiers, with considerable loss to the
aggressors.</p>

<p>Disappointed in this direct attack, the Thirty laid plans for
blockading Phylê, where they knew that there was no stock of
provisions. But hardly had their operations commenced, when a
snow-storm fell, so abundant and violent, that they were forced to
abandon their position and retire to Athens, leaving much of their
baggage in the hands of the garrison at Phylê. In the language of
Thrasybulus, this storm was characterized as providential, since the
weather had been very fine until the moment preceding, and since
it gave time to receive reinforcements which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span> made him seven hundred strong.<a
id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
Though the weather was such that the Thirty did not choose to
keep their main force in the neighborhood of Phylê, and perhaps
the Three Thousand themselves were not sufficiently hearty in the
cause to allow it, yet they sent their Lacedæmonians and two tribes
of Athenian horsemen to restrain the excursions of the garrison.
This body Thrasybulus contrived to attack by surprise. Descending
from Phylê by night, he halted within a quarter of a mile of their
position until a little before daybreak, when the night-watch
had just broken up,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419"
class="fnanchor">[419]</a> and when the grooms were making a noise
in rubbing down the horses. Just at that moment, the hoplites from
Phylê rushed upon them at a running pace, found every man unprepared,
and some even in their beds, and dispersed them with scarcely any
resistance. One hundred and twenty hoplites and a few horsemen were
slain, while abundance of arms and stores were captured and carried
back to Phylê in triumph.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a> News of the defeat was speedily conveyed
to the city, from whence the remaining horsemen immediately came
forth to the rescue, but could do nothing more than protect the
carrying off of the dead.</p>

<p>This successful engagement sensibly changed the relative situation
of parties in Attica; encouraging the exiles as much as it depressed
the Thirty. Even among the partisans of the latter at Athens,
dissension began to arise; the minority which had sympathized with
Theramenês, as well as that portion of the Three Thousand who were
least compromised as accomplices in the recent enormities, began
to waver so manifestly in their allegiance, that Kritias and his
colleagues felt some doubt of being able to maintain themselves in
the city. They resolved to secure Eleusis and the island of Salamis,
as places of safety and resource in case of being compelled to
evacuate Athens. They accordingly went to Eleusis with a considerable
number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span> the
Athenian horsemen, under pretence of examining into the strength of
the place and the number of its defenders, so as to determine what
amount of farther garrison would be necessary. All the Eleusinians
disposed and qualified for armed service, were ordered to come in
person and give in their names to the Thirty,<a id="FNanchor_421"
href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> in a building
having its postern opening on to the sea-beach; along which were
posted the horsemen and the attendants from Athens. Each Eleusinian
hoplite, after having presented himself and returned his name to the
Thirty, was ordered to pass out through this exit, where each man
successively found himself in the power of the horsemen, and was
fettered by the attendants. Lysimachus, the hipparch, or commander of
the horsemen, was directed to convey all these prisoners to Athens,
and hand them over to the custody of the Eleven.<a id="FNanchor_422"
href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Having thus seized
and carried away from Eleusis every citizen whose sentiments or
whose energy they suspected, and having left a force of their own
adherents in the place, the Thirty returned to Athens. At the same
time, it appears, a similar visit and seizure of prisoners was made
by some of them in Salamis.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423"
class="fnanchor">[423]</a> On the next day, they convoked at Athens
all their Three Thousand privileged hoplites—together with all the
remaining horsemen who had not been employed at Eleusis or Salamis—in
the Odeon, half of which was occupied by the Lacedæmonian garrison
all under arms. “Gentlemen (said Kritias, addressing his countrymen),
we keep up the government not less for your benefit than for our
own. You must therefore share with us in the danger, as well as in
the honor, of our position. Here are these Eleusinian prisoners
awaiting sentence; you must pass a vote condemning them all to death,
in order that your hopes and fears may be identified with ours.” He
then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> pointed to
a spot immediately before him and in his view, directing each man to
deposit upon it his pebble of condemnation visibly to every one.<a
id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> I
have before remarked that at Athens, open voting was well known to
be the same thing as voting under constraint; there was no security
for free and genuine suffrage except by making it secret as well as
numerous. Kritias was obeyed, without reserve or exception; probably
any dissentient would have been put to death on the spot. All the
prisoners, seemingly three hundred in number,<a id="FNanchor_425"
href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> were condemned by the
same vote, and executed forthwith.</p>

<p>Though this atrocity gave additional satisfaction and confidence
to the most violent friends of Kritias, it probably alienated
a greater number of others, and weakened the Thirty instead of
strengthening them. It contributed in part, we can hardly doubt, to
the bold and decisive resolution now taken by Thrasybulus, five days
after his late success, of marching by night from Phylê to Peiræus.<a
id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
His force, though somewhat increased, was still no more than one
thousand men; altogether inadequate by itself to any considerable
enterprise, had he not counted on positive support and junction from
fresh comrades, together with a still greater amount of negative
support from disgust or indifference towards the Thirty. He was
indeed speedily joined by many sympathizing countrymen; but few
of them, since the general disarming manœuvre of the oligarchs,
had heavy armor. Some had light shields and darts, but others were
wholly unarmed, and could merely serve as throwers of stones.<a
id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>Peiræus was at this moment an open town, deprived of its
fortifications as well as of those Long Walls which had so long
connected it with Athens. It was however of large compass, and
required an ampler force to defend it than Thrasybulus could<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span> muster. Accordingly,
when the Thirty marched out of Athens the next morning to attack him,
with their full force of Athenian hoplites and horsemen, and with
the Lacedæmonian garrison besides, he in vain attempted to maintain
against them the great carriage-road which led down to Peiræus. He
was compelled to concentrate his forces in Munychia, the easternmost
portion of the aggregate called Peiræus, nearest to the bay of
Phalêrum, and comprising one of those three ports which had once
sustained the naval power of Athens. Thrasybulus occupied the temple
of Artemis Munychia, and the adjoining Bendideion, situated in the
midst of Munychia, and accessible only by a street of steep ascent.
In the rear of his hoplites, whose files were ten deep, were posted
the darters and slingers: the ascent being so steep that these latter
could cast their missiles over the heads of the hoplites in their
front. Presently Kritias and the Thirty, having first mustered in
the market-place of Peiræus, called the Hippodamian agora, were seen
approaching with their superior numbers; mounting the hill in close
array, with hoplites not less than fifty in depth. Thrasybulus, after
an animated exhortation to his soldiers, in which he reminded them of
the wrongs which they had to avenge, and dwelt upon the advantages
of their position, which exposed the close ranks of the enemy to the
destructive effect of missiles, and would force them to crouch under
their shields so as to be unable to resist a charge with the spear
in front, waited patiently until they came within distance, standing
in the foremost rank with the prophet—habitually consulted before a
battle—by his side. The latter, a brave and devoted patriot, while
promising victory, had exhorted his comrades not to charge until some
one on their own side should be slain or wounded: he at the same
time predicted his own death in the conflict. When the troops of the
Thirty advanced near enough in ascending the hill, the light-armed in
the rear of Thrasybulus poured upon them a shower of darts over the
heads of their own hoplites, with considerable effect. As they seemed
to waver, seeking to cover themselves with their shields, and thus
not seeing well before them, the prophet, himself seemingly in arms,
set the example of rushing forward, was the first to close with the
enemy, and perished in the onset. Thrasybulus with the main body of
hoplites followed him, charged vigorously down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> the hill, and after a smart resistance,
drove them back in disorder, with the loss of seventy men. What
was of still greater moment, Kritias and Hippomachus, who headed
their troops on the left, were among the slain; together with
Charmidês son of Glaukon, one of the ten oligarchs who had been
placed to manage Peiræus.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428"
class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>This great and important advantage left the troops of Thrasybulus
in possession of seventy of the enemy’s dead, whom they stripped
of their arms, but not of their clothing, in token of respect
for fellow-countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> So disheartened, lukewarm, and disunited
were the hoplites of the Thirty, in spite of their great superiority
of number, that they sent to solicit the usual truce for burying the
dead. This was of course granted, and the two contending parties
became intermingled with each other in the performance of the funeral
duties. Amidst so impressive a scene, their common feelings as
Athenians and fellow-countrymen were forcibly brought back, and many
friendly observations were interchanged among them. Kleokritus—herald
of the mysts, or communicants in the Eleusinian mysteries, belonging
to one of the most respected gentes in the state—was among the
exiles. His voice was peculiarly loud, and the function which he held
enabled him to obtain silence while he addressed to the citizens
serving with the Thirty a touching and emphatic remonstrance: “Why
are you thus driving us into banishment, fellow-citizens? Why are
you seeking to kill us? We have never done you the least harm; we
have partaken with you in religious rites and festivals; we have been
your companions in chorus, in school, and in army; we have braved a
thousand dangers with you, by land and sea, in defence of our common
safety and freedom. I adjure you by our common gods, paternal and
maternal, by our common kindred and companionship, desist from thus
wronging your country in obedience to these nefarious Thirty, who
have slain as many citizens in eight months, for their own private
gains, as the Peloponnesians in ten years of war. These are the men
who have plunged us into wicked and odious war one against another,
when we might live together in peace. Be assured that your slain in
this battle have cost us as many tears as they have cost you.”<a
id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span></p>

<p>Such affecting appeals, proceeding from a man of respected
station like Kleokritus, and doubtless from others also, began to
work so sensibly on the minds of the citizens from Athens, that the
Thirty were obliged to give orders for immediately returning, which
Thrasybulus did not attempt to prevent, though it might have been
in his power to do so.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431"
class="fnanchor">[431]</a> But their ascendency had received a
shock from which it never fully recovered. On the next day they
appeared downcast and dispirited in the senate, which was itself
thinly attended; while the privileged Three Thousand, marshalled
in different companies on guard, were everywhere in discord and
partial mutiny. Those among them who had been most compromised in
the crimes of the Thirty, were strenuous in upholding the existing
authority; while such as had been less guilty protested against
the continuance of such unholy war, and declared that the Thirty
should not be permitted to bring Athens to utter ruin. And though
the horsemen still continued steadfast partisans, resolutely
opposing all accommodation with the exiles,<a id="FNanchor_432"
href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> yet the Thirty were
farther weakened by the death of Kritias, the ascendent and decisive
head, and at the same time the most cruel and unprincipled among
them; while that party, both in the senate and out of it, which
had formerly adhered to Theramenês, now again raised its head. A
public meeting among them was held, in which what may be called
the opposition-party among the Thirty, that which had opposed the
extreme enormities of Kritias, became predominant. It was determined
to depose the Thirty, and to constitute a fresh oligarchy of Ten,
one from each tribe.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a> But the members of the Thirty were
individually reëligible; so that two of them, Eratosthenês and
Pheidon, if not more, adherents of Theramenês and unfriendly to
Kritias and Chariklês,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434"
class="fnanchor">[434]</a> with others of the same vein of sentiment,
were chosen among the Ten. Chariklês and the more violent members,
having thus lost their ascendency, no longer deemed themselves safe
at Athens, but retired to Eleusis, which they had had the precaution
to occupy beforehand. Prob<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p.
272]</span>ably a number of their partisans, and the Lacedæmonian
garrison also, retired thither along with them.</p>

<p>The nomination of this new oligarchy of Ten was plainly a
compromise, adopted by some from sincere disgust at the oligarchical
system, and desire to come to accommodation with the exiles; by
others, from a conviction that the only way of maintaining the
oligarchical system, and repelling the exiles, was to constitute a
new oligarchical Board, dismissing that which had become obnoxious.
The latter was the purpose of the horsemen, the main upholders of
the first Board as well as of the second; and such also was soon
seen to be the policy of Eratosthenês and his colleagues. Instead
of attempting to agree upon terms of accommodation with the exiles
in Peiræus generally, they merely tried to corrupt separately
Thrasybulus and the leaders, offering to admit ten of them to a share
of the oligarchical power at Athens, provided they would betray their
party. This offer having been indignantly refused, the war was again
resumed between Athens and Peiræus, to the bitter disappointment,
not less of the exiles than of that portion of the Athenians who had
hoped better things from the new Board of Ten.<a id="FNanchor_435"
href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>But the forces of oligarchy were seriously enfeebled at Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> as
well by the secession of all the more violent spirits to Eleusis, as
by the mistrust, discord, and disaffection which now reigned within
the city. Far from being able to abuse power like their predecessors,
the Ten did not even fully confide in their three thousand hoplites,
but were obliged to take measures for the defence of the city in
conjunction with the hipparch and the horsemen, who did double
duty,—on horseback in the day-time, and as hoplites with their
shields along the walls at night, for fear of surprise,—employing
the Odeon as their head-quarters. The Ten sent envoys to Sparta to
solicit farther aid; while the Thirty sent envoys thither also,
from Eleusis, for the same purpose; both representing that the
Athenian people had revolted from Sparta, and required farther
force to reconquer them.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437"
class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span></p>

<p>Such foreign aid became daily more necessary to them, since the
forces of Thrasybulus in Peiræus grew stronger, before their eyes,
in numbers, in arms, and in hope of success; exerting themselves,
with successful energy, to procure additional arms and shields,
though some of the shields, indeed, were no better than wood-work or
wicker-work whitened over.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438"
class="fnanchor">[438]</a> Many exiles flocked in to their aid,
while others sent donations of money or arms: among the latter,
the orator Lysias stood conspicuous, transmitting to Peiræus a
present of two hundred shields as well as two thousand drachms in
money, and hiring besides three hundred fresh soldiers; while his
friend Thrasydæus, the leader of the democratical interest at Elis,
was induced to furnish a loan of two talents.<a id="FNanchor_439"
href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Others also lent
money; some Bœotians furnished two talents, and a person named
Gelarchus contributed the large sum of five talents, repaid in
after times by the people.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440"
class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Proclamation was made by Thrasybulus,
that all metics who would lend aid should be put on the footing of
isotely, or equal payment of taxes with citizens, exempt from the
metic-tax and other special burdens. Within a short time he had got
together a considerable force both in heavy-armed and light-armed,
and even seventy horsemen; so that he was in condition to make
excursions out of Peiræus, and to collect wood and provisions.
Nor did the Ten venture to make any aggressive movement out of
Athens, except so far as to send out the horsemen, who slew or
captured stragglers from the force of Thrasybulus. Lysimachus
the hipparch, the same who had commanded under the Thirty at the
seizure of the Eleusinian citizens, having made prisoners some
young Athenians, bringing in provisions from the country for the
consumption of the troops in Peiræus, put them to death, in spite of
remonstrances from several even of his own men; for which cruelty
Thrasybulus retaliated, by putting to death a horseman named<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span> Kallistratus, made
prisoner in one of their marches to the neighboring villages.<a
id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>In the established civil war which now raged in Attica,
Thrasybulus and the exiles in Peiræus had decidedly the advantage;
maintaining the offensive, while the Ten in Athens, and the remainder
of the Thirty at Eleusis, were each thrown upon their defence. The
division of the oligarchical force into these two sections doubtless
weakened both, while the democrats in Peiræus were hearty and united.
Presently, however, the arrival of a Spartan auxiliary force altered
the balance of parties. Lysander, whom the oligarchical envoys
had expressly requested to be sent to them as general, prevailed
with the ephors to grant their request. While he himself went to
Eleusis and got together a Peloponnesian land-force, his brother
Libys conducted a fleet of forty triremes to block up Peiræus, and
one hundred talents were lent to the Athenian oligarchs out of the
large sum recently brought from Asia into the Spartan treasury.<a
id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>The arrival of Lysander brought the two sections of oligarchs
in Attica again into coöperation, restrained the progress of
Thrasybulus, and even reduced Peiræus to great straits by preventing
all entry of ships or stores. Nor could anything have prevented it
from being reduced to surrender, if Lysander had been allowed free
scope in his operations. But the general sentiment of Greece had
by this time become disgusted with his ambitious policy, and with
the oligarchies which he had everywhere set up as his instruments;
a sentiment not without influence on the feelings of the leading
Spartans, who, already jealous of his ascendency, were determined not
to increase it farther by allowing him to conquer Attica a second
time, in order to plant his own creatures as rulers at Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span></p>
<p>Under the influence of these feelings, king Pausanias obtained
the consent of three out of the five ephors to undertake himself
an expedition into Attica, at the head of the forces of the
confederacy, for which he immediately issued proclamation. Opposed
to the political tendencies of Lysander, he was somewhat inclined to
sympathize with the democracy, not merely at Athens, but elsewhere
also, as at Mantineia.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444"
class="fnanchor">[444]</a> It was probably understood that his
intentions towards Athens were lenient and anti-Lysandrian, so that
the Peloponnesian allies obeyed the summons generally: yet the
Bœotians and Corinthians still declined, on the ground that Athens
had done nothing to violate the late convention; a remarkable proof
of the altered feelings of Greece during the last year, since, down
to the period of that convention, these two states had been more
bitterly hostile to Athens than any others in the confederacy. They
suspected that even the expedition of Pausanias was projected with
selfish Lacedæmonian views, to secure Attica as a separate dependency
of Sparta, though detached from Lysander.<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>On approaching Athens, Pausanias, joined by Lysander and the
forces already in Attica, encamped in the garden of the Academy,
near the city gates. His sentiments were sufficiently known
beforehand to offer encouragement; so that the vehement reaction
against the atrocities of the Thirty, which the presence of Lysander
had doubtless stifled, burst forth without delay. The surviving
relatives of the victims slain beset him even at the Academy in his
camp, with prayers for protection and cries of vengeance against
the oligarchs. Among those victims, as I have already stated, were
Nikêratus the son, and Eukratês the brother, of Nikias who had
perished at Syracuse, the friend and proxenus of Sparta at Athens.
The orphan children, both of Nikêratus and Eukratês, were taken to
Pausanias by their relative Diognêtus, who implored his protection
for them, recounting at the same time the unmerited execution of
their respective fathers, and setting forth their family claims
upon the justice of Sparta. This affecting incident, which has been
specially made known to us,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446"
class="fnanchor">[446]</a> doubtless did not stand alone, among so
many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> families
suffering from the same cause. Pausanias was furnished at once with
ample grounds, not merely for repudiating the Thirty altogether,
and sending back the presents which they tendered to him,<a
id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
but even for refusing to identify himself unreservedly with the
new oligarchy of Ten which had risen upon their ruins. The voice
of complaint—now for the first time set free, with some hopes
of redress—must have been violent and unmeasured, after such a
career as that of Kritias and his colleagues; while the fact was
now fully manifested, which could not well have come forth into
evidence before, that the persons despoiled and murdered had been
chiefly opulent men, and very frequently even oligarchical men,
not politicians of the former democracy. Both Pausanias, and the
Lacedæmonians along with him, on reaching Athens, must have been
strongly affected by the facts which they learned, and by the loud
cry for sympathy and redress which poured upon them from the most
innocent and respected families. The predisposition both of the
king and the ephors against the policy of Lysander was materially
strengthened, as well as their inclination to bring about an
accommodation of parties, instead of upholding by foreign force an
anti-popular Few.</p>

<p>Such convictions would become farther confirmed as Pausanias
saw and heard more of the real state of affairs. At first, he
held a language decidedly adverse to Thrasybulus and the exiles,
sending to them a herald, and requiring them to disband and go to
their respective homes.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The requisition not being obeyed, he
made a faint attack upon Peiræus, which had no effect. Next day he
marched down with two Lacedæmonian moræ, or large military divisions,
and three tribes of the Athenian horsemen, to reconnoitre the
place, and see where a line of blockade could be drawn. Some light
troops annoyed him, but his troops repulsed<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span> them, and pursued them even as far as
the theatre of Peiræus, where all the forces of Thrasybulus were
mustered, heavy-armed, as well as light-armed. The Lacedæmonians
were here in a disadvantageous position, probably in the midst of
houses and streets, so that all the light-armed of Thrasybulus were
enabled to set upon them furiously from different sides, and drive
them out again with loss, two of the Spartan polemarchs being here
slain. Pausanias was obliged to retreat to a little eminence about
half a mile off, where he mustered his whole force, and formed his
hoplites into a very deep phalanx. Thrasybulus on his side was
so encouraged by the recent success of his light-armed, that he
ventured to bring out his heavy-armed, only eight deep, to an equal
conflict on the open ground. But he was here completely worsted,
and driven back into Peiræus with the loss of one hundred and fifty
men; so that the Spartan king was able to retire to Athens after a
victory, and a trophy erected to commemorate it.<a id="FNanchor_449"
href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The issue of this battle was one extremely fortunate for
Thrasybulus and his comrades; since it left the honors of the day
with Pausanias, so as to avoid provoking enmity or vengeance on his
part, while it showed plainly that the conquest of Peiræus, defended
by so much courage and military efficiency, would be no easy matter.
It disposed Pausanias still farther towards an accommodation;
strengthening also the force of that party in Athens which was
favorable to the same object, and adverse to the Ten oligarchs.
This opposition-party found decided favor with the Spartan king,
as well as with the ephor Naukleidas, who was present along with
him. Numbers of Athenians, even among those Three Thousand by whom
the city was now exclusively occupied, came forward to deprecate
farther war with Peiræus, and to entreat that Pausanias would
settle the quarrel so as to leave them all at amity with Lacedæmon.
Xenophon, indeed, according to that narrow and partial spirit which
pervades his Hellenica, notices no sentiment in Pausanias except his
jealousy of Lysander, and treats the opposition against the Ten at
Athens as having been got up by his intrigues.<a id="FNanchor_450"
href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> But it seems<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> plain that this is
not a correct account. Pausanias did not create the discord, but
found it already existing, and had to choose which of the parties
he would adopt. The Ten took up the oligarchical game after it
had been thoroughly dishonored and ruined by the Thirty: they
inspired no confidence, nor had they any hold upon the citizens
in Athens, except in so far as these latter dreaded reactionary
violence, in case Thrasybulus and his companions should reënter by
force; accordingly, when Pausanias was there at the head of a force
competent to prevent such dangerous reaction, the citizens at once
manifested their dispositions against the Ten, and favorable to peace
with Peiræus. To second this pacific party was at once the easiest
course for Pausanias to take, and the most likely to popularize
Sparta in Greece; whereas, he would surely have entailed upon her
still more bitter curses from without, not to mention the loss of
men to herself, if he had employed the amount of force requisite to
uphold the Ten, and subdue Peiræus. To all this we have to add his
jealousy of Lysander, as an important predisposing motive, but only
as auxiliary among many others.</p>

<p>Under such a state of facts, it is not surprising to learn that
Pausanias encouraged solicitations for peace from Thrasybulus and
the exiles, and that he granted them a truce to enable them to send
envoys to Sparta. Along with these envoys went Kephisophon and
Melitus, sent for the same purpose of entreating peace, by the party
opposed to the Ten at Athens, under the sanction both of Pausanias
and of the accompanying ephors. On the other hand, the Ten, finding
themselves discountenanced by Pausanias, sent envoys of their own
to outbid the others. They tendered themselves, their walls, and
their city, to be dealt with as the Lacedæmonians chose; requiring
that Thrasybulus, if he pretended to be the friend of Sparta, should
make the same unqualified surrender of Peiræus and Munychia. All
the three sets of envoys were heard before the ephors remaining at
Sparta and the Lacedæmonian assembly; who took the best resolution
which the case admitted, to bring to pass an amicable settlement
between Athens and Peiræus, and to leave the terms to be fixed by
fifteen commissioners, who were sent thither forthwith to sit in
conjunction with Pausanias. This Board determined, that the exiles in
Peiræus should be readmitted to Athens, that an accommodation<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> should take place, and
that no man should be molested for past acts, except the Thirty,
the Eleven (who had been the instruments of all executions), and
the Ten who had governed in Peiræus. But Eleusis was recognized as
a government separate from Athens, and left, as it already was, in
possession of the Thirty and their coadjutors, to serve as a refuge
for all those who might feel their future safety compromised at
Athens in consequence of their past conduct.<a id="FNanchor_451"
href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>As soon as these terms were proclaimed, accepted, and sworn to by
all parties, Pausanias with all the Lacedæmonians evacuated Attica.
Thrasybulus and the exiles marched up in solemn procession from
Peiræus to Athens. Their first act was to go up to the acropolis, now
relieved from its Lacedæmonian garrison, and there to offer sacrifice
and thanksgiving. On descending from thence, a general assembly was
held, in which—unanimously and without opposition, as it should
seem—the democracy was restored. The government of the Ten, which
could have no basis except the sword of the foreigner, disappeared as
a matter of course; but Thrasybulus, while he strenuously enforced
upon his comrades from Peiræus a full respect for the oaths which
they had sworn, and an unreserved harmony with their newly acquired
fellow-citizens, admonished the assembly emphatically as to the past
events. “You city-men (he said), I advise you to take just measure
of yourselves for the future; and to calculate fairly, what ground
of superiority you have, so as to pretend to rule over us? Are you
juster than we? Why the demos, though poorer than you, never at any
time wronged you for purposes of plunder; while you, the wealthiest
of all, have done many base deeds for the sake of gain. Since then
you have no justice to boast of, are you superior to us on the score
of courage? There cannot be a better trial, than the war which has
just ended. Again, can you pretend to be superior in policy? you,
who, having a fortified city, an armed force, plenty of money, and
the Peloponnesians for your allies, have been overcome by men who
had nothing of the kind to aid them? Can you boast of your hold
over the Lacedæmonians? Why, they have just handed you over, like
a vicious dog with a clog tied to him, to the very demos<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> whom you have wronged,
and are now gone out of the country. But you have no cause to be
uneasy for the future. I adjure you, my friends from Peiræus, in
no point to violate the oaths which we have just sworn. Show, in
addition to your other glorious exploits, that you are honest and
true to your engagements.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>The archons, the senate of Five Hundred, the public assembly,
and the dikasteries, appear to have been now revived, as they had
stood in the democracy prior to the capture of the city by Lysander.
This important restoration seems to have taken place some time in
the spring of 403 <small>B.C.</small>, though we cannot
exactly make out in what month. The first archon now drawn was
Eukleidês, who gave his name to this memorable year; a year never
afterwards forgotten by Athenians.</p>

<p>Eleusis was at this time, and pursuant to the late convention, a
city independent and separate from Athens, under the government of
the Thirty, and comprising their warmest partisans. It was not likely
that this separation would last; but the Thirty were themselves the
parties to give cause for its termination. They were getting together
a mercenary force at Eleusis, when the whole force of Athens was
marched to forestall their designs. The generals at Eleusis came
forth to demand a conference, but were seized and put to death; the
Thirty themselves, and a few of the most obnoxious individuals,
fled out of Attica; while the rest of the Eleusinian occupants were
persuaded by their friends from Athens to come to an equal and
honorable accommodation. Again Eleusis became incorporated in the
same community with Athens, oaths of mutual amnesty and harmony
being sworn by every one.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453"
class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have now passed that short, but bitter and sanguinary
interval, occupied by the Thirty, which succeeded so immediately
upon the extinction of the empire and independence of Athens<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span> as to leave no
opportunity for pause or reflection. A few words respecting the rise
and fall of that empire are now required, summing up as it were
the political moral of the events recorded in my last two volumes,
between 477 and 405 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>I related, in the forty-fifth chapter, the steps by which Athens
first acquired her empire, raised it to its maximum, including both
maritime and inland dominion, then lost the inland portion of it;
which loss was ratified by the Thirty Years Truce concluded with
Sparta and the Peloponnesian confederacy in 445 <small>B.C.</small>
Her maritime empire was based upon the confederacy of Delos, formed
by the islands in the Ægean and the towns on the seaboard immediately
after the battles of Platæa and Mykalê, for the purpose not merely
of expelling the Persians from the Ægean, but of keeping them away
permanently. To the accomplishment of this important object, Sparta
was altogether inadequate; nor would it ever have been accomplished,
if Athens had not displayed a combination of military energy, naval
discipline, power of organization, and honorable devotion to a great
Pan-Hellenic purpose, such as had never been witnessed in Grecian
history.</p>

<p>The confederacy of Delos was formed by the free and spontaneous
association of many different towns, all alike independent; towns
which met in synod and deliberated by equal vote, took by their
majority resolutions binding upon all, and chose Athens as their
chief to enforce these resolutions, as well as to superintend
generally the war against the common enemy. But it was, from the
beginning, a compact which permanently bound each individual state to
the remainder. None had liberty either to recede, or to withhold the
contingent imposed by authority of the common synod, or to take any
separate step inconsistent with its obligations to the confederacy.
No union less stringent than this could have prevented the renewal of
Persian ascendency in the Ægean. Seceding or disobedient states were
thus treated as guilty of treason or revolt, which it was the duty of
Athens, as chief, to repress. Her first repressions, against Naxos
and other states, were undertaken in prosecution of this duty, in
which if she had been wanting, the confederacy would have fallen to
pieces, and the common enemy would have reappeared.</p>

<p>Now the only way by which the confederacy was saved from
falling to pieces, was by being transformed into an Athenian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p. 282]</span> empire. Such
transformation, as Thucydidês plainly intimates,<a id="FNanchor_454"
href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> did not arise
from the ambition or deep-laid projects of Athens, but from the
reluctance of the larger confederates to discharge the obligations
imposed by the common synod, and from the unwarlike character of the
confederates generally, which made them desirous to commute military
service for money-payment, while Athens on her part was not less
anxious to perform the service and obtain the money. By gradual and
unforeseen stages, Athens thus passed from consulate to empire: in
such manner that no one could point out the precise moment of time
when the confederacy of Delos ceased, and when the empire began.
Even the transfer of the common fund from Delos to Athens, which
was the palpable manifestation of a change already realized, was
not an act of high-handed injustice in the Athenians, but warranted
by prudential views of the existing state of affairs, and even
proposed by a leading member of the confederacy.<a id="FNanchor_455"
href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>But the Athenian empire came to include (between 460-446
<small>B.C.</small>) other cities, not parties to the confederacy of
Delos. Athens had conquered her ancient enemy the island of Ægina,
and had acquired supremacy over Megara, Bœotia, Phocis, and Lokris,
and Achaia in Peloponnesus. The Megarians joined her to escape the
oppression of their neighbor Corinth: her influence over Bœotia was
acquired by allying herself with a democratical party in the Bœotian
cities, against Sparta, who had been actively interfering to sustain
the opposite party and to renovate the ascendency of Thebes. Athens
was, for the time, successful in all these enterprises; but if we
follow the details, we shall not find her more open to reproach on
the score of aggressive tendencies than Sparta or Corinth. Her empire
was now at its maximum; and had she been able to maintain it,—or
even to keep possession of the Megarid separately, which gave her
the means of barring out all invasions from Peloponnesus,—the future
course of Grecian history would have been materially altered. But
her empire on land did not rest upon the same footing as her empire
at sea. The exiles in Megara and Bœotia, etc., and the anti-Athenian
party generally in those places,—combined with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> the rashness of her general Tolmidês at
Korôneia,—deprived her of all her land-dependencies near home, and
even threatened her with the loss of Eubœa. The peace concluded in
445 <small>B.C.</small> left her with all her maritime and insular
empire, including Eubœa, but with nothing more; while by the loss of
Megara she was now open to invasion from Peloponnesus.</p>

<p>On this footing she remained at the beginning of the Peloponnesian
war fourteen years afterwards. I have shown that that war did
not arise, as has been so often asserted, from aggressive or
ambitious schemes on the part of Athens, but that, on the contrary,
the aggression was all on the side of her enemies; who were
full of hopes that they could put her down with little delay;
while she was not merely conservative and defensive, but even
discouraged by the certainty of destructive invasion, and only
dissuaded from concessions, alike imprudent and inglorious, by
the extraordinary influence and resolute wisdom of Periklês. That
great man comprehended well both the conditions and the limits of
Athenian empire. Athens was now understood, especially since the
revolt and reconquest of the powerful island of Samos in 440 <small>B.C.</small>, by her subjects and enemies as well as
by her own citizens, to be mistress of the sea. It was the care
of Periklês to keep that belief within definite boundaries, and
to prevent all waste of the force of the city in making new or
distant acquisitions which could not be permanently maintained. But
it was also his care to enforce upon his countrymen the lesson of
maintaining their existing empire unimpaired, and shrinking from no
effort requisite for that end. Though their whole empire was now
staked upon the chances of a perilous war, he did not hesitate to
promise them success, provided that they adhered to this conservative
policy.</p>

<p>Following the events of the war, we shall find that Athens did
adhere to it for the first seven years; years of suffering and trial,
from the destructive annual invasion, the yet more destructive
pestilence, and the revolt of Mitylênê, but years which still left
her empire unimpaired, and the promises of Periklês in fair chance
of being realized. In the seventh year of the war occurred the
unexpected victory at Sphakteria and the capture of the Lacedæmonian
prisoners. This placed in the hands of the Athenians a capital
advantage, imparting to them prodigious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span> confidence of future success, while
their enemies were in a proportional degree disheartened. It was
in this temper that they first departed from the conservative
precept of Periklês, and attempted to recover (in 424 <small>B.C.</small>) both Megara and Bœotia. Had the great
statesman been alive,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456"
class="fnanchor">[456]</a> he might have turned this moment of
superiority to better account, and might perhaps have contrived
even to get possession of Megara—a point of unspeakable importance
to Athens, since it protected her against invasion—in exchange for
the Spartan captives. But the general feeling of confidence which
then animated all parties at Athens, determined them in 424 <small>B.C.</small> to grasp at this and much more by force.
They tried to reconquer both Megara and Bœotia: in the former
they failed, though succeeding so far as to capture Nisæa; in the
latter they not only failed, but suffered the disastrous defeat of
Delium.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of that same year 424 <small>B.C.</small>, too, that Brasidas broke into their empire
in Thrace, and robbed them of Akanthus, Stageira, and some other
towns, including their most precious possession, Amphipolis. Again,
it seems that the Athenians, partly from the discouragement caused by
the disaster at Delium, partly from the ascendency of Nikias and the
peace party, departed from the conservative policy of Periklês; not
by ambitious over-action, but by inaction, omitting to do all that
might have been done to arrest the progress of Brasidas. We must,
however, never forget that their capital loss, Amphipolis, was owing
altogether to the improvidence of their officers, and could not have
been obviated even by Periklês.</p>

<p>But though that great man could not have prevented the loss, he
would assuredly have deemed no efforts too great to recover it; and
in this respect his policy was espoused by Kleon, in opposition to
Nikias and the peace party. The latter thought it wise to make the
truce for a year; which so utterly failed of its effect, that Nikias
was obliged, even in the midst of it, to conduct an armament to
Pallênê in order to preserve the empire against yet farther losses.
Still, Nikias and his friends would hear of nothing but peace; and
after the expedition of Kleon against Amphipolis in the ensuing
year, which failed partly through his mili<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span>tary incapacity, partly through the want
of hearty concurrence in his political opponents, they concluded
what is called the Peace of Nikias in the ensuing spring. In this,
too, their calculations are not less signally falsified than in the
previous truce: they stipulate that Amphipolis shall be restored,
but it is as far from being restored as ever. To make the error
still graver and more irreparable, Nikias, with the concurrence of
Alkibiadês contracts the alliance with Sparta a few months after the
peace, and gives up the captives, the possession of whom being the
only hold which Athens as yet had upon the Spartans.</p>

<p>We thus have, during the four years succeeding the battle of
Delium (424-420 <small>B.C.</small>), a series of
departures from the conservative policy of Periklês; departures,
not in the way of ambitious over-acquisition, but of languor and
unwillingness to make efforts even for the recovery of capital
losses. Those who see no defects in the foreign policy of the
democracy except those of over-ambition and love of war, pursuant
to the jest of Aristophanês, overlook altogether these opposite but
serious blunders of Nikias and the peace party.</p>

<p>Next comes the ascendency of Alkibiadês, leading to the two
years’ campaign in Peloponnesus in conjunction with Elis, Argos, and
Mantineia, and ending in the complete reëstablishment of Lacedæmonian
supremacy. Here was a diversion of Athenian force from its legitimate
purpose of preserving or reëstablishing the empire, for inland
projects which Periklês could never have approved. The island of
Melos undoubtedly fell within his general conceptions of tenable
empire for Athens. But we may regard it as certain that he would
have recommended no new projects, exposing Athens to the reproach
of injustice, so long as the lost legitimate possessions in Thrace
remained unconquered.</p>

<p>We now come to the expedition against Syracuse. Down to that
period, the empire of Athens, except the possessions in Thrace,
remained undiminished, and her general power nearly as great as
it had ever been since 445 <small>B.C.</small> That
expedition was the one great and fatal departure from the Periklean
policy, bringing upon Athens an amount of disaster from which she
never recovered; and it was doubtless an error of over-ambition.
Acquisitions in Sicily, even if made, lay out of the condi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>tions of permanent
empire for Athens; and however imposing the first effect of success
might have been, they would only have disseminated her strength,
multiplied her enemies, and weakened her in all quarters. But
though the expedition itself was thus indisputably ill-advised, and
therefore ought to count to the discredit of the public judgment at
Athens, we are not to impute to that public an amount of blame in
any way commensurate to the magnitude of the disaster, except in
so far as they were guilty of unmeasured and unconquerable esteem
for Nikias. Though Periklês would have strenuously opposed the
project, yet he could not possibly have foreseen the enormous ruin
in which it would end; nor could such ruin have been brought about
by any man existing, save Nikias. Even when the people committed
the aggravated imprudence of sending out the second expedition,
Demosthenês doubtless assured them that he would speedily either take
Syracuse or bring back both armaments, with a fair allowance for the
losses inseparable from failure; and so he would have done, if the
obstinacy of Nikias had permitted. In measuring therefore the extent
of misjudgment fairly imputable to the Athenians for this ruinous
undertaking, we must always recollect, that first the failure of the
siege, next the ruin of the armament, did not arise from intrinsic
difficulties in the case, but from the personal defects of the
commander.</p>

<p>After the Syracusan disaster, there is no longer any question
about adhering to, or departing from, the Periklean policy. Athens
is like Patroklus in the Iliad, after Apollo has stunned him by a
blow on the back and loosened his armor. Nothing but the slackness
of her enemies allowed her time for a partial recovery, so as
to make increased heroism a substitute for impaired force, even
against doubled and tripled difficulties. And the years of struggle
which she now went through are among the most glorious events in
her history. These years present many misfortunes, but no serious
misjudgment, not to mention one peculiarly honorable moment, after
the overthrow of the Four Hundred. I have in the two preceding
chapters examined into the blame imputed to the Athenians for not
accepting the overtures of peace after the battle of Kyzikus,
and for dismissing Alkibiadês after the battle of Notium. On
both points their conduct has been shown to be justifiable. And
after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span> all, they
were on the point of partially recovering themselves in 408 <small>B.C.</small>, when the unexpected advent of Cyrus set
the seal to their destiny.</p>

<p>The bloodshed after the recapture of Mitylênê and Skionê, and
still more that which succeeded the capture of Melos, are disgraceful
to the humanity of Athens, and stand in pointed contrast with the
treatment of Samos when reconquered by Periklês. But they did
not contribute sensibly to break down her power; though, being
recollected with aversion after other incidents were forgotten,
they are alluded to in later times as if they had caused the
fall of the empire.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457"
class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>I have thought it important to recall, in this short summary,
the leading events of the seventy years preceding 405 <small>B.C.</small>, in order that it may be understood to
what degree Athens was politically or prudentially to blame for
the great downfall which she then underwent. That downfall had
one great cause—we may almost say, one single cause—the Sicilian
expedition. The empire of Athens both was, and appeared to be, in
exuberant strength when that expedition was sent forth; strength
more than sufficient to bear up against all moderate faults or
moderate misfortunes, such as no government ever long escapes. But
the catastrophe of Syracuse was something overpassing in terrific
calamity all Grecian experience and all power of foresight. It was
like the Russian campaign of 1812 to the emperor Napoleon; though
by no means imputable, in an equal degree, to vice in the original
project. No Grecian power could bear up against such a death-wound,
and the prolonged struggle of Athens after it is not the least
wonderful part of the whole war.</p>

<p>Nothing in the political history of Greece is so remarkable as
the Athenian empire; taking it as it stood in its completeness,
from about 460-413 <small>B.C.</small>, the date of
the Syracusan catastrophe, or still more, from 460-421 <small>B.C.</small>, the date when Brasidas made his conquests
in Thrace. After the Syracusan catastrophe, the conditions of the
empire were altogether changed; it was irretrievably broken up,
though Athens still continued an energetic<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span> struggle to retain some of the
fragments. But if we view it as it had stood before that event,
during the period of its integrity, it is a sight marvellous to
contemplate, and its working must be pronounced, in my judgment, to
have been highly beneficial to the Grecian world. No Grecian state
except Athens could have sufficed to organize such a system, or to
hold in partial though regulated, continuous, and specific communion,
so many little states, each animated with that force of political
repulsion instinctive in the Grecian mind. This was a mighty task,
worthy of Athens, and to which no state except Athens was competent.
We have already seen in part, and we shall see still farther, how
little qualified Sparta was to perform it, and we shall have occasion
hereafter to notice a like fruitless essay on the part of Thebes.</p>

<p>As in regard to the democracy of Athens generally, so in regard
to her empire, it has been customary with historians to take notice
of little except the bad side. But my conviction is, and I have
shown grounds for it, in chap. xlvii, that the empire of Athens was
not harsh and oppressive, as it is commonly depicted. Under the
circumstances of her dominion, at a time when the whole transit and
commerce of the Ægean was under one maritime system, which excluded
all irregular force; when Persian ships of war were kept out of
the waters, and Persian tribute-officers away from the seaboard;
when the disputes inevitable among so many little communities
could be peaceably redressed by the mutual right of application to
the tribunals at Athens, and when these tribunals were also such
as to present to sufferers a refuge against wrongs done even by
individual citizens of Athens herself, to use the expression of the
oligarchical Phrynichus,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458"
class="fnanchor">[458]</a> the condition of the maritime Greeks was
materially better than it had been before, or than it will be seen
to become afterwards. Her empire, if it did not inspire attachment,
certainly provoked no antipathy, among the bulk of the citizens
of the subject-communities, as is shown by the party-character of
the revolts against her. If in her imperial character she exacted
obedience, she also fulfilled duties and insured protection to a
degree incomparably greater than was ever<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span> realized by Sparta. And even if she
had been ever so much disposed to cramp the free play of mind and
purpose among her subjects,—a disposition which is no way proved,—the
very circumstances of her own democracy, with its open antithesis
of political parties, universal liberty of speech, and manifold
individual energy, would do much to prevent the accomplishment
of such an end, and would act as a stimulus to the dependent
communities, even without her own intention.</p>

<p>Without being insensible either to the faults or to the misdeeds
of imperial Athens, I believe that her empire was a great comparative
benefit, and its extinction a great loss, to her own subjects. But
still more do I believe it to have been a good, looked at with
reference to Pan-Hellenic interests. Its maintenance furnished the
only possibility of keeping out foreign intervention, and leaving the
destinies of Greece to depend upon native, spontaneous, untrammelled
Grecian agencies. The downfall of the Athenian empire is the signal
for the arms and corruption of Persia again to make themselves
felt, and for the reënslavement of the Asiatic Greeks under her
tribute-officers. What is still worse, it leaves the Grecian world
in a state incapable of repelling any energetic foreign attack, and
open to the overruling march of “the man of Macedon,” half a century
afterwards. For such was the natural tendency of the Grecian world
to political non-integration or disintegration, that the rise of
the Athenian empire, incorporating so many states into one system,
is to be regarded as a most extraordinary accident. Nothing but the
genius, energy, discipline, and democracy of Athens, could have
brought it about; nor even she, unless favored and pushed on by a
very peculiar train of antecedent events. But having once got it, she
might perfectly well have kept it; and, had she done so, the Hellenic
world would have remained so organized as to be able to repel foreign
intervention, either from Susa or from Pella. When we reflect how
infinitely superior was the Hellenic mind to that of all surrounding
nations and races; how completely its creative agency was stifled,
as soon as it came under the Macedonian dictation; and how much more

half-century of freedom, under the stimulating headship of the<span

action, and mental grandeur.</p>

  FROM THE RESTORATION OF THE DEMOCRACY TO THE DEATH
  OF ALKIBIADES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">The</span> period intervening
between the defeat of Ægospotami (October, 405 <small>B.C.</small>) and the reëstablishment of the democracy
as sanctioned by the convention concluded with Pausanias, some time
in the summer of 403 <small>B.C.</small>, presents two
years of cruel and multifarious suffering to Athens. For seven years
before, indeed ever since the catastrophe at Syracuse, she had been
struggling with hardships; contending against augmented hostile
force, while her own means were cut down in every way; crippled at
home by the garrison of Dekeleia; stripped to a great degree both of
her tribute and her foreign trade, and beset by the snares of her own
oligarchs. In spite of circumstances so adverse, she had maintained
the fight with a resolution not less surprising than admirable;
yet not without sinking more and more towards impoverishment and
exhaustion. The defeat of Ægospotami closed the war at once, and
transferred her from her period of struggle to one of concluding
agony. Nor is the last word by any means too strong for the reality.
Of these two years, the first portion was marked by severe physical
privation, passing by degrees into absolute famine, and accompanied
by the intolerable sentiment of despair and helplessness against her
enemies, after two generations of imperial grandeur, not without
a strong chance of being finally consigned to ruin and individual
slavery; while the last portion comprised all the tyranny, murders,
robberies, and expulsions perpetrated by the Thirty, overthrown
only by heroic efforts of patriotism on the part of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span> exiles; which a
fortunate change of sentiment, on the part of Pausanias, and the
leading members of the Peloponnesian confederacy, ultimately crowned
with success.</p>

<p>After such years of misery, it was an unspeakable relief to the
Athenian population to regain possession of Athens and Attica,
to exchange their domestic tyrants for a renovated democratical
government, and to see their foreign enemies not merely evacuate
the country, but even bind themselves by treaty to future friendly
dealing. In respect of power, indeed, Athens was but the shadow
of her former self. She had no empire, no tribute, no fleet, no
fortifications at Peiræus, no long walls, not a single fortified
place in Attica except the city itself. Of all these losses, however,
the Athenians probably made little account, at least at the first
epoch of their reëstablishment; so intolerable was the pressure which
they had just escaped, and so welcome the restitution of comfort,
security, property, and independence, at home. The very excess of
tyranny committed by the Thirty gave a peculiar zest to the recovery
of the democracy. In their hands, the oligarchical principle,
to borrow an expression from Mr. Burke,<a id="FNanchor_459"
href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> “had produced
in fact, and instantly, the grossest of those evils with which
it was pregnant in its nature;” realizing the promise of that
plain-spoken oligarchical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p.
292]</span> oath, which Aristotle mentions as having been taken
in various oligarchical cities, to contrive as much evil as
possible to the people.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460"
class="fnanchor">[460]</a> So much the more complete was the reaction
of sentiment towards the antecedent democracy, even in the minds of
those who had been before discontented with it. To all men, rich
and poor, citizens and metics, the comparative excellence of the
democracy, in respect of all the essentials of good government,
was now manifest. With the exception of those who had identified
themselves with the Thirty as partners, partisans, or instruments,
there was scarcely any one who did not feel that his life and
property had been far more secure under the former democracy,
and would become so again if that democracy were revived.<a
id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>It was the first measure of Thrasybulus and his companions, after
concluding the treaty with Pausanias, and thus reëntering the city,
to exchange solemn oaths, of amnesty for the past, with those against
whom they had just been at war. Similar oaths of amnesty were also
exchanged with those in Eleusis, as soon as that town came into
their power. The only persons excepted from this amnesty were the
Thirty, the Eleven who had presided over the execution of all their
atrocities, and the Ten who had governed in Peiræus. Even these
persons were not peremptorily banished: opportunity was offered to
them to come in and take their trial of accountability (universal
at Athens in the case of every magistrate on quitting office); so
that, if acquitted, they would enjoy the benefit of the amnesty
as well as all others.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462"
class="fnanchor">[462]</a> We know that Eratosthenês, one of the
Thirty, afterwards returned to Athens; since there remains a powerful
harangue of Lysias, invoking justice against him as having brought
to death Polemarchus, the brother of Lysias. Eratosthenês was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> one of the minority
of the Thirty who sided generally with Theramenês, and opposed to
a considerable degree the extreme violences of Kritias, although
personally concerned in that seizure and execution of the rich metics
which Theramenês had resisted, and which was one of the grossest
misdeeds even of that dark period. He and Pheidon, being among the
Ten named to succeed the Thirty after the death of Kritias, when
the remaining members of that deposed Board retired to Eleusis, had
endeavored to maintain themselves as a new oligarchy, carrying on war
at the same time against Eleusis and against the democratical exiles
in Peiræus. Failing in this, they had retired from the country, at
the time when these exiles returned, and when the democracy was first
reëstablished. But after a certain interval, the intense sentiments
of the moment having somewhat subsided, they were encouraged by
their friends to return, and came back to stand their trial of
accountability. It was on that occasion that Lysias preferred his
accusation against Eratosthenês, the result of which we do not know,
though we see plainly, even from the accusatory speech, that the
latter had powerful friends to stand by him, and that the dikasts
manifested considerable reluctance to condemn.<a id="FNanchor_463"
href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> We learn, moreover,
from the same speech, that such was the detestation of the Thirty
among several of the states surrounding Attica, as to cause<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span> formal decrees for
their expulsion, or for prohibiting their coming.<a id="FNanchor_464"
href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The sons, even of
such among the Thirty as did not return, were allowed to remain
at Athens, and enjoy their rights of citizens, unmolested;<a
id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> a
moderation rare in Grecian political warfare.</p>

<p>The first public vote of the Athenians, after the conclusion
of peace with Sparta and the return of the exiles, was to restore
the former democracy purely and simply, to choose by lot the nine
archons and the senate of Five Hundred, and to elect the generals,
all as before. It appears that this restoration of the preceding
constitution was partially opposed by a citizen named Phormisius,
who, having served with Thrasybulus in Peiræus, now moved that the
political franchise should for the future be restricted to the
possessors of land in Attica. His proposition was understood to be
supported by the Lacedæmonians, and was recommended as calculated
to make Athens march in better harmony with them. It was presented
as a compromise between oligarchy and democracy, excluding both the
poorer freemen and those whose property lay either in movables or in
land out of Attica; so that the aggregate number of the disfranchised
would have been five thousand persons. Since Athens now had lost her
fleet and maritime empire, and since the importance of Peiræus was
much curtailed not merely by these losses, but by demolition of its
separate walls and of the long walls, Phormisius and others conceived
the opportunity favorable for striking out the maritime and trading
multitude from the roll of citizens. Many of these men must have
been in easy and even opulent circumstances, but the bulk of them
were poor; and Phormisius had of course at his command the usual
arguments, by which it is attempted to prove that poor men have no
business with political judgment or action. But the proposition was
rejected; the orator Lysias being among its opponents, and composing
a speech against it which was either spoken, or intended to be
spoken, by some eminent citizen in the assembly.<a id="FNanchor_466"
href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have only a fragment of the speech remain<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>ing, wherein the
proposition is justly criticized as mischievous and unseasonable,
depriving Athens of a large portion of her legitimate strength,
patriotism, and harmony, and even of substantial men competent to
serve as hoplites or horsemen, at a moment when she was barely rising
from absolute prostration. Never, certainly, was the fallacy which
connects political depravity or incapacity with a poor station,
and political virtue or judgment with wealth, more conspicuously
unmasked, than in reference to the recent experience of Athens.
The remark of Thrasybulus was most true,<a id="FNanchor_467"
href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> that a greater number
of atrocities, both against person and against property, had been
committed in a few months by the Thirty, and abetted by the class
of horsemen, all rich men, than the poor majority of the Demos had
sanctioned during two generations of democracy. Moreover, we know,
on the authority of a witness unfriendly to the democracy, that the
poor Athenian citizens, who served on shipboard and elsewhere, were
exact in obedience to their commanders; while the richer citizens
who served as hoplites and horsemen, and who laid claim to higher
individual estimation, were far less orderly in the public service.<a
id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>The motion of Phormisius being rejected, the antecedent democracy
was restored without qualification, together with the ordinances of
Drako, and the laws, measures, and weights of Solon. But on closer
inspection, it was found that this latter part of the resolution was
incompatible with the amnesty which had been just sworn. According
to the laws of Solon and Drako, the perpetrators of enormities under
the Thirty had rendered themselves guilty, and were open to trial.
To escape this consequence, a second psephism or decree was passed,
on the proposition of Tisamenus, to review the laws of Solon and
Drako, and reënact them with such additions and amendments as might
be deemed expedient. Five hundred citizens had been just chosen by
the people as nomothetæ, or law-makers, at the same time when the
senate of Five hundred was taken by lot: out of these nomothetæ,
the senate now chose a select few, whose duty it was to consider
all propositions for amendment or addition to the laws of the
old democracy, and post them up for public<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span> inspection before the statues of the
eponymous heroes, within the month then running.<a id="FNanchor_469"
href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> The senate, and the
entire body of five hundred nomothetæ, were then to be convened,
in order that each might pass in review, separately, both the old
laws and the new propositions; the nomothetæ being previously sworn
to decide righteously. While this discussion was going on, every
private citizen had liberty to enter the senate, and to tender his
opinion with reasons for or against any law. All the laws which
should thus be approved, first by the senate, and afterwards by the
nomothetæ, but no others, were to be handed to the magistrates, and
inscribed on the walls of the portico called Pœkilê, for public
notoriety, as the future regulators of the city. After the laws were
promulgated by such public inscription, the senate of Areopagus was
enjoined to take care that they should be duly observed and enforced
by the magistrates. A provisional committee of twenty citizens was
named, to be generally responsible for the city during the time
occupied in this revision.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470"
class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the laws had been revised and publicly inscribed<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> in the pœkilê, pursuant
to the above decree, two concluding laws were enacted, which
completed the purpose of the citizens.</p>

<p>The first of these laws forbade the magistrates to act upon, or
permit to be acted upon, any law not among those inscribed; and
declared that no psephism, either of the senate or of the people,
should overrule any law.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471"
class="fnanchor">[471]</a> It renewed also the old prohibition,
dating from the days of Kleisthenês, and the first origin of the
democracy, to enact a special law inflicting direct hardship upon any
individual Athenian apart from the rest, unless by the votes of six
thousand citizens voting secretly.</p>

<p>The second of the two laws prescribed, that all the legal
adjudications and arbitrations which had been passed under the
antecedent democracy should be held valid and unimpeached, but
formally annulled all which had been passed under the Thirty. It
farther provided, that the laws now revised and inscribed should
only take effect from the archonship of Eukleidês; that is,
from the nomination of archons made after the recent return of
Thrasybulus and renovation of the democracy.<a id="FNanchor_472"
href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span></p> <p>By these
ever-memorable enactments, all acts done prior to the nomination of
the archon Eukleidês and his colleagues, in the summer of 403 <small>B.C.</small>, were excluded from serving as grounds
for criminal process against any citizen. To insure more fully that
this should be carried into effect, a special clause was added to
the oath taken annually by the senators, as well as to that taken by
the Heliastic dikasts. The senators pledged themselves by oath not
to receive any impeachment, or give effect to any arrest, founded on
any fact prior to the archonship of Eukleidês, excepting only against
the Thirty, and the other individuals expressly shut out from the
amnesty, and now in exile.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473"
class="fnanchor">[473]</a> To the oath annually taken by the
Heliasts, also, was added the clause: “I will not remember past
wrongs, nor will I abet any one else who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> shall remember them; on the contrary,<a
id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
I will give my vote pursuant to the existing laws;” which laws
proclaimed themselves as only taking effect from the archonship of
Eukleidês.</p>

<p>A still farther precaution was taken to bar all actions for
redress or damages founded on acts done prior to the archonship
of Eukleidês. On the motion of Archinus, the principal colleague
of Thrasybulus at Phylê, a law was passed, granting leave to any
defendant against whom such an action might be brought, to plead
an exception in bar, or paragraphê, upon the special ground of the
amnesty and the legal prescription connected with it. The legal
effect of this paragraphê, or exceptional plea, in Attic procedure,
was to increase both the chance of failure, and the pecuniary
liabilities in case of failure, on the part of the plaintiff; also,
to better considerably the chances of the defendant. This enactment
is said to have been moved by Archinus, on seeing that some persons
were beginning to institute actions at law, in spite of the amnesty;
and for the better prevention of all such claims.<a id="FNanchor_475"
href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span></p> <p>By these
additional enactments, security was taken that the proceedings of
the courts of justice should be in full conformity with the amnesty
recently sworn, and that, neither directly nor indirectly, should
any person be molested for wrongs done anterior to Eukleidês. And,
in fact, the amnesty was faithfully observed: the reëntering exiles
from Peiræus, and the horsemen with other partisans of the Thirty
in Athens, blended again together into one harmonious and equal
democracy.</p>

<p>Eight years prior to these incidents, we have seen the
oligarchical conspiracy of the Four Hundred for a moment successful,
and afterwards overthrown; and we have had occasion to notice, in
reference to that event, the wonderful absence of all reactionary
violence on the part of the victorious people, at a moment of severe
provocation for the past and extreme apprehension for the future.
We noticed that Thucydidês, no friend to the Athenian democracy,
selected precisely that occasion—on which some manifestation of
vindictive impulse might have been supposed likely and natural—to
bestow the most unqualified eulogies on their moderate and gentle
bearing. Had the historian lived to describe the reign of the
Thirty and the restoration which followed it, we cannot doubt that
his expressions would have been still warmer and more emphatic in
the same sense. Few events in history, either ancient or modern,
are more astonishing than the behavior of the Athenian people,
on recovering their democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty:
and when we view it in conjunction with the like phenomenon after
the deposition of the Four Hundred, we see that neither the one
nor the other arose from peculiar caprice or accident of the
moment; both depended upon permanent attri<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span>butes of the popular character. If we
knew nothing else except the events of these two periods, we should
be warranted in dismissing, on that evidence alone, the string of
contemptuous predicates,—giddy, irascible, jealous, unjust, greedy,
etc., one or other of which Mr. Mitford so frequently pronounces,
and insinuates even when he does not pronounce them, respecting
the Athenian people.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476"
class="fnanchor">[476]</a> A people, whose habitual temper and
morality merited these epithets, could not have acted as the
Athenians acted both after the Four Hundred and after the Thirty.
Particular acts may be found in their history which justify severe
censure; but as to the permanent elements of character, both moral
and intellectual, no population in history has ever afforded stronger
evidence than the Athenians on these two memorable occasions.</p>

<p>If we follow the acts of the Thirty, we shall see that the
horsemen and the privileged three thousand hoplites in the city<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> had made themselves
partisans in every species of flagitious crime which could possibly
be imagined to exasperate the feelings of the exiles. The latter,
on returning, saw before them men who had handed in their relations
to be put to death without trial, who had seized upon and enjoyed
their property, who had expelled them all from the city, and a
large portion of them even from Attica; and who had held themselves
in mastery not merely by the overthrow of the constitution, but
also by inviting and subsidizing foreign guards. Such atrocities,
conceived and ordered by the Thirty, had been executed by the
aid, and for the joint benefit, as Kritias justly remarked,<a
id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
of those occupants of the city whom the exiles found on returning.
Now Thrasybulus, Anytus, and the rest of these exiles, saw their
property all pillaged and appropriated by others during the few
months of their absence: we may presume that their lands—which
had probably not been sold, but granted to individual members or
partisans of the Thirty<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478"
class="fnanchor">[478]</a>—were restored to them; but the movable
property could not be reclaimed, and the losses to which they
remained subject were prodigious. The men who had caused and
profited by these losses<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479"
class="fnanchor">[479]</a>—often with great brutality towards the
wives and families of the exiles, as we know by the case of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span> the orator Lysias—were
now at Athens, all individually well known to the sufferers. In
like manner, the sons and brothers of Leon and the other victims
of the Thirty, saw before them the very citizens by whose hands
their innocent relatives had been consigned without trial to
prison and execution.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a> The amount of wrong suffered had been
infinitely greater than in the time of the Four Hundred, and
the provocation, on every ground, public and private, violent
to a degree never exceeded in history. Yet with all this sting
fresh in their bosoms, we find the victorious multitude, on the
latter occasion as well as on the former, burying the past in an
indiscriminate amnesty, and anxious only for the future harmonious
march of the renovated and all-comprehensive democracy. We see the
sentiment of commonwealth in the Demos, twice contrasted with the
sentiment of faction in an ascendent oligarchy;<a id="FNanchor_481"
href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> twice triumphant over
the strongest counter-motives, over the most bitter recollections
of wrongful murder and spoliation, over all that passionate rush of
reactionary appetite which characterizes the moment of political
restoration. “Bloody will be the reign of that king who comes back
to his kingdom from exile,” says the Latin poet: bloody, indeed,
had been the rule of Kritias and those oligarchs who had just come
back from exile: “Harsh is a Demos (observes Æschylus) which has
just got clear of misery.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482"
class="fnanchor">[482]</a> But the Athenian Demos, on coming back
from Peiræus, exhibited the rare phenomenon of a restoration,
after cruel wrong suffered, sacrificing all the strong impulse of
retaliation to a generous and deliberate regard for the future
march of the commonwealth. Thucydidês remarks that the moderation
of political antipathy which prevailed at Athens after the victory
of the people over the Four Hundred, was the main cause which
revived Athens from her great public depres<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>sion and danger.<a id="FNanchor_483"
href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Much more forcibly
does this remark apply to the restoration after the Thirty, when the
public condition of Athens was at the lowest depth of abasement, from
which nothing could have rescued her except such exemplary wisdom and
patriotism on the part of her victorious Demos. Nothing short of this
could have enabled her to accomplish that partial resurrection—into
an independent and powerful single state, though shorn of her
imperial power—which will furnish material for the subsequent portion
of our History.</p>

<p>While we note the memorable resolution of the Athenian people
to forget that which could not be remembered without ruin to the
future march of the democracy, we must at the same time observe that
which they took special pains to preserve from being forgotten.
They formally recognized all the adjudged cases and all the rights
of property as existing under the democracy anterior to the Thirty.
“You pronounced, fellow-citizens (says Andokidês), that all the
judicial verdicts and all the decisions of arbitrators passed under
the democracy should remain valid, in order that there might be no
abolition of debts, no reversal of private rights, but that every man
might have the means of enforcing contracts due to him by others.”<a
id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> If
the Athenian people had been animated by that avidity to despoil the
rich, and that subjection to the passion of the moment, which Mr.
Mitford imputes to them in so many chapters of his history, neither
motive nor opportunity was now wanting for wholesale confiscation,
of which the rich themselves, during the dominion of the Thirty,
had set abundant example. The amnesty as to political wrong, and
the indelible memory as to the rights of property, stand alike
conspicuous as evidences of the real character of the Athenian
Demos.</p>

<p>If we wanted any farther proof of their capacity of taking the
largest and soundest views on a difficult political situation,
we should find it in another of their measures at this critical
period.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> The Ten
who had succeeded to the oligarchical presidency of Athens after
the death of Kritias and the expulsion of the Thirty, had borrowed
from Sparta the sum of one hundred talents, for the express purpose
of making war on the exiles in Peiræus. After the peace, it was
necessary that such sum should be repaid, and some persons proposed
that recourse should be had to the property of those individuals and
that party who had borrowed the money. The apparent equity of the
proposition was doubtless felt with peculiar force at a time when
the public treasury was in the extreme of poverty. But nevertheless
both the democratical leaders and the people decidedly opposed
it, resolving to recognize the debt as a public charge; in which
capacity it was afterwards liquidated, after some delay arising from
an unsupplied treasury.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485"
class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<p>All that was required from the horsemen, or knights, who had been
active in the service of the Thirty, was that they should repay
the sums which had been advanced to them by the latter as outfit.
Such advance to the horsemen, subject to subsequent repayment,
and seemingly distinct from the regular military pay, appears to
have been a customary practice under the previous democracy;<a
id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
but we may easily believe that the Thirty had carried it to
an abusive excess, in their anxiety to enlist or stimulate
partisans, when we recollect that they resorted to means more
nefarious for the same end. There were of course great individual
differences among these knights, as to the degree in which each
had lent himself to the misdeeds of the oligarchy. Even the most
guilty of them were not molested, and they were sent, four<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> years afterwards,
to serve with Agesilaus in Asia, at a time when the Lacedæmonians
required from Athens a contingent of cavalry;<a id="FNanchor_487"
href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> the Demos being
well pleased to be able to provide for them an honorable foreign
service. But the general body of knights suffered so little
disadvantage from the recollection of the Thirty, that many of them
in after days became senators, generals, hipparchs, and occupants
of other considerable posts in the state.<a id="FNanchor_488"
href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Although the decree of Tisamenus—prescribing a revision of the
laws without delay, and directing that the laws, when so revised,
should be posted up for public view, to form the sole and exclusive
guide of the dikasteries—had been passed immediately after the return
from Peiræus and the confirmation of the amnesty, yet it appears that
considerable delay took place before such enactment was carried into
full effect. A person named Nikomachus was charged with the duty, and
stands accused of having performed it tardily as well as corruptly.
He, as well as Tisamenus,<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489"
class="fnanchor">[489]</a> was a scribe, or secretary; under which
name were included a class of paid officers, highly important in the
detail of business at Athens, though seemingly men of low birth,
and looked upon as filling a subordinate station, open to sneers
from unfriendly orators. The boards, the magistrates, and the public
bodies were so frequently changed at Athens, that the continuity of
public business could only have been maintained by paid secretaries
of this character, who devoted themselves constantly to the duty.<a
id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span></p>

<p>Nikomachus had been named, during the democracy anterior to
the Thirty, for the purpose of preparing a fair transcript, and
of posting up afresh, probably in clearer characters, and in a
place more convenient for public view, the old laws of Solon. We
can well understand that the renovated democratical feeling, which
burst out after the expulsion of the Four Hundred, and dictated
the vehement psephism of Demophantus, might naturally also produce
such a commission as this, for which Nikomachus, both as one of
the public scribes, or secretaries, and as an able speaker,<a
id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
was a suitable person. His accuser, for whom Lysias composed his
thirtieth oration, now remaining, denounces him as having not only
designedly lingered in the business, for the purpose of prolonging
the period of remuneration, but even as having corruptly tampered
with the old laws, by new interpolations, as well as by omissions.
How far such charges may have been merited, we have no means of
judging; but even assuming Nikomachus to have been both honest and
diligent, he would find no small difficulty in properly discharging
his duty of anagrapheus,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492"
class="fnanchor">[492]</a> or “writer-up” of all the old laws of
Athens, from Solon downward. Both the phraseology of these old laws,
and the alphabet in which they were written, were in many cases
antiquated and obsolete;<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a> while there were doubtless also cases in
which one law was at variance, wholly or partially, with another. Now
such contradictions and archaisms would be likely to prove offensive,
if set up in a fresh place, and with clean, new characters; while
Nikomachus had no authority to make the smallest alteration, and
might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span> naturally
therefore be tardy in a commission which did not promise much credit
to him in its result.</p>

<p>These remarks tend to show that the necessity of a fresh
collection and publication, if we may use that word, of the laws, had
been felt prior to the time of the Thirty. But such a project could
hardly be realized without at the same time revising the laws, as a
body, removing all flagrant contradictions, and rectifying what might
glaringly displease the age, either in substance or in style. Now
the psephism of Tisamenus, one of the first measures of the renewed
democracy after the Thirty, both prescribed such revision and set in
motion a revising body; but an additional decree was now proposed and
carried by Archinus, relative to the alphabet in which the revised
laws should be drawn up. The Ionic alphabet—that is, the full Greek
alphabet of twenty-four letters, as now written and printed—had been
in use at Athens universally, for a considerable time, apparently for
two generations; but from tenacious adherence to ancient custom, the
laws had still continued to be consigned to writing in the old Attic
alphabet of only sixteen or eighteen letters. It was now ordained
that this scanty alphabet should be discontinued, and that the
revised laws, as well as all future public acts, should be written up
in the full Ionic alphabet.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494"
class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Partly through this important reform, partly through the revising
body, partly through the agency of Nikomachus, who was still
continued as anagrapheus, the revision, inscription, and publication
of the laws in their new alphabet was at length completed. But it
seems to have taken two years to perform, or at least two years
elapsed before Nikomachus went through his trial of accountability.<a
id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
He appears to have made various new propositions of his own, which
were among those adopted by the nomothetæ: for these his accuser
attacks him, on the trial of accountability, as well as on the still
graver allegation, of having corruptly falsified the decisions of
that body; writing up what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p.
309]</span> they had not sanctioned, or suppressing that which
they had sanctioned.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496"
class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>The archonship of Eukleidês, succeeding immediately to the
anarchy,—as the archonship of Pythodôrus, or the period of the
Thirty, was denominated,—became thus a cardinal point or epoch in
Athenian history. We cannot doubt that the laws came forth out of
this revision considerably modified, though unhappily we possess no
particulars on the subject. We learn that the political franchise
was, on the proposition of Aristophon, so far restricted for the
future, that no person could be a citizen by birth except the son
of citizen-parents, on both sides; whereas previously, it had been
sufficient if the father alone was a citizen.<a id="FNanchor_497"
href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The rhetor Lysias,
by station a metic, had not only suffered great loss, narrowly
escaping death from the Thirty, who actually put to death his brother
Polemarchus, but had contributed a large sum to assist the armed
efforts of the exiles under Thrasybulus in Peiræus. As a reward
and compensation for such antecedents, the latter proposed that
the franchise of citizen should be conferred upon him; but we are
told that this decree, though adopted by the people, was afterwards
indicted by Archinus as illegal or informal, and cancelled. Lysias,
thus disappointed of the citizenship, passed the remainder of
his life as an isoteles, or non-freeman on the best condition,
exempt from the peculiar burdens upon the class of metics.<a
id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>Such refusal of citizenship to an eminent man like Lysias, who
had both acted and suffered in the cause of the democracy, when
combined with the decree of Aristophon above noticed, implies a
degree of augmented strictness which we can only partially explain.
It was not merely the renewal of her democracy for which Athens
had now to provide. She had also to accommodate her legislation
and administration to her future march as an<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span> isolated state, without empire or
foreign dependencies. For this purpose, material changes must
have been required: among others, we know that the Board of
Hellenotamiæ—originally named for the collection and management
of the tribute at Delos, but attracting to themselves gradually
more extended functions, until they became ultimately, immediately
before the Thirty, the general paymasters of the state—was
discontinued, and such among its duties as did not pass away along
with the loss of the foreign empire, were transferred to two new
officers, the treasurer at war, and the manager of the theôrikon, or
religious festival-fund.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499"
class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Respecting these two new departments,
the latter of which especially became so much extended as to
comprise most of the disbursements of a peace-establishment, I
shall speak more fully hereafter; at present, I only notice them
as manifestations of the large change in Athenian administration
consequent upon the loss of the empire. There were doubtless many
other changes arising from the same cause, though we do not know
them in detail; and I incline to number among such the alteration
above noticed respecting the right of citizenship. While the Athenian
empire lasted, the citizens of Athens were spread over the Ægean
in every sort of capacity, as settlers, merchants, navigators,
soldiers, etc.; which must have tended materially to encourage
intermarriages between them and the women of other Grecian insular
states. Indeed, we are even told that an express permission of
connubium with Athenians was granted to the inhabitants of Eubœa,<a
id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> a
fact, noticed by Lysias, of some moment in illustrating the tendency
of the Athenian empire to multiply family ties between Athens
and the allied cities. Now, according to the law which prevailed
before Eukleidês, the son of every such marriage was by birth an
Athenian citizen, an arrangement at that time useful to Athens, as
strengthening the bonds of her empire, and eminently useful in a
larger point of view, among the causes of Pan-Hellenic sympathy.
But when Athens was deprived both of her empire and her fleet,
and confined within the limits of Attica,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> there no longer remained any motive
to continue such a regulation, so that the exclusive city-feeling,
instinctive in the Grecian mind, again became predominant. Such is,
perhaps, the explanation of the new restrictive law proposed by
Aristophon.</p>

<p>Thrasybulus and the gallant handful of exiles who had first seized
Phylê, received no larger reward than one thousand drachmæ for a
common sacrifice and votive offering, together with wreaths of olive
as a token of gratitude from their countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_501"
href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The debt which Athens
owed to Thrasybulus was indeed such as could not be liquidated by
money. To his individual patriotism, in great degree, we may ascribe
not only the restoration of the democracy, but its good behavior
when restored. How different would have been the consequences of the
restoration and the conduct of the people, had the event been brought
about by a man like Alkibiadês, applying great abilities principally
to the furtherance of his own cupidity and power!</p>

<p>At the restoration of the democracy, however, Alkibiadês was
already no more. Shortly after the catastrophe at Ægospotami,
he had sought shelter in the satrapy of Pharnabazus, no longer
thinking himself safe from Lacedæmonian persecution in his forts
on the Thracian Chersonese. He carried with him a good deal of
property, though he left still more behind him, in these forts;
how acquired, we do not know. But having crossed apparently to
Asia by the Bosphorus, he was plundered by the Thracians in
Bithynia, and incurred much loss before he could reach Pharnabazus
in Phrygia. Renewing the tie of personal hospitality which he had
contracted with Pharnabazus four years before,<a id="FNanchor_502"
href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> he now solicited
from the satrap a safe-conduct up to Susa. The Athenian envoys—whom
Pharnabazus, after his former pacification with Alkibiadês in
408 <small>B.C.</small>, had engaged to escort to
Susa, but had been compelled by the mandate of Cyrus to detain as
prisoners—were just now released from their three years’ detention,
and enabled to come down to the Propontis;<a id="FNanchor_503"
href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> and Alkibiadês, by
whom this mission had originally been pro<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span>jected, tried to prevail on the satrap
to perform the promise which he had originally given, but had not
been able to fulfil. The hopes of the sanguine exile, reverting
back to the history of Themistoklês, led him to anticipate the same
success at Susa as had fallen to the lot of the latter; nor was the
design impracticable, to one whose ability was universally renowned,
and who had already acted as minister to Tissaphernês.</p>

<p>The court of Susa was at this time in a peculiar position. King
Darius Nothus, having recently died, had been succeeded by his eldest
son Artaxerxes Mnemon;<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a> but the younger son Cyrus, whom Darius
had sent for during his last illness, tried after the death of the
latter to supplant Artaxerxes in the succession, or at least was
suspected of so trying. Being seized and about to be slain, the
queen-mother Parysatis prevailed upon Artaxerxes to pardon him, and
send him again down to his satrapy along the coast of Ionia, where
he labored strenuously, though secretly, to acquire the means of
dethroning his brother; a memorable attempt, of which I shall speak
more fully hereafter. But his schemes, though carefully masked,
did not escape the observation of Alkibiadês, who wished to make a
merit of revealing them at Susa, and to become the instrument of
defeating them. He communicated his suspicions as well as his purpose
to Pharnabazus; whom he tried to awaken by alarm of danger to the
empire, in order that he might thus get himself forwarded to Susa as
informant and auxiliary.</p>

<p>Pharnabazus was already jealous and unfriendly in spirit
towards Lysander and the Lacedæmonians, of which we shall soon
see plain evidence, and perhaps towards Cyrus also, since such
were the habitual relations of neighboring satraps in the Persian
empire. But the Lacedæmonians and Cyrus were now all-powerful on
the Asiatic coast, so that he probably did not dare to exasperate
them, by identifying himself with a mission so hostile and an enemy
so dangerous to both. Accordingly, he refused compliance with the
request of Alkibiadês; granting him, nevertheless, permission to live
in Phrygia, and even assigning to him a revenue. But the objects at
which the exile was aiming soon became more or less fully divulged,
to those against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span>
whom they were intended. His restless character, enterprise, and
capacity, were so well known as to raise exaggerated fears as well as
exaggerated hopes. Not merely Cyrus, but the Lacedæmonians, closely
allied with Cyrus, and the dekadarchies, whom Lysander had set up in
the Asiatic Grecian cities, and who held their power only through
Lacedæmonian support, all were uneasy at the prospect of seeing
Alkibiadês again in action and command, amidst so many unsettled
elements. Nor can we doubt that the exiles whom these dekadarchies
had banished, and the disaffected citizens who remained at home
under their government in fear of banishment or death, kept up
correspondence with him, and looked to him as a probable liberator.
Moreover, the Spartan king, Agis, still retained the same personal
antipathy against him, which had already some years before procured
the order to be despatched, from Sparta to Asia, to assassinate
him. Here are elements enough, of hostility, vengeance, and
apprehension, afloat against Alkibiadês, without believing the story
of Plutarch, that Kritias and the Thirty sent to apprize Lysander
that the oligarchy at Athens could not stand, so long as Alkibiadês
was alive. The truth is, that though the Thirty had included him
in the list of exiles,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a> they had much less to dread from his
assaults or plots, in Attica, than the Lysandrian dekadarchies in
the cities of Asia. Moreover, his name was not popular even among
the Athenian democrats, as will be shown hereafter, when we come
to recount the trial of Sokratês. Probably, therefore, the alleged
intervention of Kritias and the Thirty, to procure the murder of
Alkibiadês, is a fiction of the subsequent encomiasts of the latter
at Athens, in order to create for him claims to esteem as a friend
and fellow-sufferer with the democracy.</p>

<p>A special despatch, or skytalê, was sent out by the Spartan
authorities to Lysander in Asia, enjoining him to procure that
Alkibiadês should be put to death. Accordingly, Lysander communicated
this order to Pharnabazus, within whose satrapy Alkibiadês was
residing, and requested that it might be put in execution. The
whole character of Pharnabazus shows that he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> would not perpetrate such a deed,
towards a man with whom he had contracted ties of hospitality,
without sincere reluctance and great pressure from without;
especially as it would have been easy for him to connive underhand
at the escape of the intended victim. We may therefore be sure
that it was Cyrus, who, informed of the revelations contemplated
by Alkibiadês, enforced the requisition of Lysander; and that the
joint demand of the two was too formidable even to be evaded, much
less openly disobeyed. Accordingly, Pharnabazus despatched his
brother Magæus and his uncle Sisamithres with a band of armed men,
to assassinate Alkibiadês in the Phrygian village where he was
residing. These men, not daring to force their way into his house,
surrounded it and set it on fire; but Alkibiadês, having contrived to
extinguish the flames, rushed out upon his assailants with a dagger
in his right hand, and a cloak wrapped round his left to serve as a
shield. None of them dared to come near him; but they poured upon him
showers of darts and arrows until he perished, undefended as he was
either by shield or by armor. A female companion with whom he lived,
Timandra, wrapped up his body in garments of her own, and performed
towards it all the last affectionate solemnities.<a id="FNanchor_506"
href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Such was the deed which Cyrus and the Lacedæmonians did not
scruple to enjoin, nor the uncle and brother of a Persian satrap to
execute, and by which this celebrated Athenian perished, before he
had attained the age of fifty. Had he lived, we cannot doubt that he
would again have played some conspicuous part,—for neither his temper
nor his abilities would have allowed him to remain in the shade,—but
whether to the advantage of Athens or not, is more questionable.
Certain it is, that taking his life throughout, the good which he did
to her bore no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span>
proportion to the far greater evil. Of the disastrous Sicilian
expedition, he was more the cause than any other individual, though
that enterprise cannot properly be said to have been caused by any
individual, but rather to have emanated from a national impulse.
Having first, as a counsellor, contributed more than any other man
to plunge the Athenians into this imprudent adventure, he next, as
an exile, contributed more than any other man, except Nikias, to
turn that adventure into ruin, and the consequences of it into still
greater ruin. Without him, Gylippus would not have been sent to
Syracuse, Dekeleia would not have been fortified, Chios and Milêtus
would not have revolted, the oligarchical conspiracy of the Four
Hundred would not have been originated. Nor can it be said that
his first three years of political action as Athenian leader, in a
speculation peculiarly his own,—the alliance with Argos, and the
campaigns in Peloponnesus,—proved in any way advantageous to his
country. On the contrary, by playing an offensive game where he had
hardly sufficient force for a defensive, he enabled the Lacedæmonians
completely to recover their injured reputation and ascendency through
the important victory of Mantineia. The period of his life really
serviceable to his country, and really glorious to himself, was
that of three years ending with his return to Athens in 407 <small>B.C.</small> The results of these three years of success
were frustrated by the unexpected coming down of Cyrus as satrap:
but, just at the moment when it behooved Alkibiadês to put forth a
higher measure of excellence, in order to realize his own promises in
the face of this new obstacle, at that critical moment we find him
spoiled by the unexpected welcome which had recently greeted him at
Athens, and falling miserably short even of the former merit whereby
that welcome had been earned.</p>

<p>If from his achievements we turn to his dispositions, his ends,
and his means, there are few characters in Grecian history who
present so little to esteem, whether we look at him as a public or as
a private man. His ends are those of exorbitant ambition and vanity,
his means rapacious as well as reckless, from his first dealing with
Sparta and the Spartan envoys, down to the end of his career. The
manœuvres whereby his political enemies first procured his exile
were indeed base and guilty in a high degree; but we must recollect
that if his enemies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p.
316]</span> more numerous and violent than those of any other
politician in Athens, the generating seed was sown by his own
overweening insolence, and contempt of restraints, legal as well as
social.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he was never once defeated either by land or
sea. In courage, in ability, in enterprise, in power of dealing with
new men and new situations, he was never wanting; qualities, which,
combined with his high birth, wealth, and personal accomplishments,
sufficed to render him for the time the first man in every successive
party which he espoused; Athenian, Spartan, or Persian; oligarchical
or democratical. But to none of them did he ever inspire any
lasting confidence; all successively threw him off. On the whole,
we shall find few men in whom eminent capacities for action and
command are so thoroughly marred by an assemblage of bad moral
qualities, as Alkibiadês.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507"

  THE DRAMA. — RHETORIC AND DIALECTICS. — THE SOPHISTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">Respecting</span> the
political history of Athens during the few years immediately
succeeding the restoration of the democracy, we have unfortunately
little or no information. But in the spring of 399 <small>B.C.</small>, between three and four years after the
beginning of the archonship of Eukleidês, an event happened of
paramount interest to the intellectual public of Greece as well as
to philosophy generally, the trial, condemnation, and execution of
Sokratês. Before I recount that memorable incident, it will be proper
to say a few words on the literary and philosophical character of
the age in which it happened. Though literature and philosophy are
now becoming separate departments in Greece, each exercises a marked
influence on the other, and the state of dramatic literature will be
seen to be one of the causes directly contributing to the fate of
Sokratês.</p>

<p>During the century of the Athenian democracy between Kleisthenês
and Eukleidês, there had been produced a development of dramatic
genius, tragic and comic, never paralleled before or afterwards.
Æschylus, the creator of the tragic drama, or at least the first
composer who rendered it illustrious, had been a combatant both at
Marathon and Salamis; while Sophoklês and Euripidês, his two eminent
followers, the former one of the generals of the Athenian armament
against Samos in 440 <small>B.C.</small>, expired both
of them only a year before the battle of Ægospotami, just in time to
escape the bitter humiliation and suffering of that mournful period.
Out of the once numerous compositions of these poets we possess only
a few, yet sufficient to enable us to appreciate in some degree
the grandeur of Athenian tragedy; and when we learn that they were
frequently beaten, even with the best of their dramas now remaining,
in fair competition for the prize against other poets whose names
only have reached us, we are warranted in presuming that the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> best productions of
these successful competitors, if not intrinsically finer, could
hardly have been inferior in merit to theirs.<a id="FNanchor_508"
href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>The tragic drama belonged essentially to the festivals in honor
of the god Dionysus; being originally a chorus sung in his honor,
to which were successively superadded, first, an Iambic monologue;
next, a dialogue with two actors; lastly, a regular plot with
three actors, and the chorus itself interwoven into the scene.
Its subjects were from the beginning, and always continued to be,
persons either divine or heroic, above the level of historical life,
and borrowed from what was called the mythical past: the Persæ of
Æschylus forms a splendid exception; but the two analogous dramas
of his contemporary, Phrynichus, the Phœnissæ and the capture of
Milêtus, were not successful enough to invite subsequent tragedians
to meddle with contemporary events. To three serious dramas, or a
trilogy, at first connected together by sequence of subject more or
less loose, but afterwards unconnected and on distinct subjects,
through an innovation introduced by Sophoklês, if not before, the
tragic poet added a fourth or satyrical drama; the characters of
which were satyrs, the companions of the god Dionysus, and other
heroic or mythical persons exhibited in farce. He thus made up a
total of four dramas, or a tetralogy, which he got up and brought
forward to contend for the prize at the festival. The expense of
training the chorus and actors was chiefly furnished by the chorêgi,
wealthy citizens, of whom one was named for each of the ten tribes,
and whose honor and vanity were greatly interested in obtaining the
prize. At first, these exhibitions took place on a temporary stage,
with nothing but wooden supports and scaffolding; but shortly after
the year 500 <small>B.C.</small>, on an occasion when the poets
Æschylus and Pratinas were contending for the prize, this stage gave
way during the ceremony, and lamentable mischief was the result.
After that misfortune, a permanent theatre of stone was provided. To
what extent the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span>
project was realized before the invasion of Xerxes, we do not
accurately know; but after his destructive occupation of Athens,
the theatre, if any existed previously, would have to be rebuilt or
renovated along with other injured portions of the city.</p>

<p>It was under that great development of the power of Athens
which followed the expulsion of Xerxes, that the theatre with its
appurtenances attained full magnitude and elaboration, and Attic
tragedy its maximum of excellence. Sophoklês gained his first victory
over Æschylus in 468 <small>B.C.</small>: the first
exhibition of Euripidês was in 455 <small>B.C.</small>
The names, though unhappily the names alone, of many other
competitors have reached us: Philoklês, who gained the prize even
over the Œdipus Tyrannus of Sophoklês; Euphorion son of Æschylus,
Xenoklês, and Nikomachus, all known to have triumphed over Euripidês;
Neophron, Achæus, Ion, Agathon, and many more. The continuous
stream of new tragedy, poured out year after year, was something
new in the history of the Greek mind. If we could suppose all the
ten tribes contending for the prize every year, there would be ten
tetralogies—or sets of four dramas each, three tragedies and one
satyrical farce—at the Dionysiac festival, and as many at the Lenæan.
So great a number as sixty new tragedies composed every year,<a
id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> not to be
thought of; yet we do not know what was the usual number of competing
tetralogies: it was at least three; since the first, second, and
third are specified in the didaskalies, or theatrical records, and
probably greater than three. It was rare to repeat the same drama a
second time unless after considerable alterations; nor would it be
creditable to the liberality of a chorêgus to decline the full cost
of getting up a new tetralogy. Without pretending to determine with
numerical accuracy how many dramas were composed in each year, the
general fact of unexampled abundance in the productions of the tragic
muse is both authentic and interesting.</p>

<p>Moreover, what is not less important to notice, all this
abundance found its way to the minds of the great body of the
citizens, not excepting even the poorest. For the theatre is said
to have accommodated thirty thousand persons:<a id="FNanchor_510"
href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> here again it is
unsafe to rely upon numerical accuracy, but we cannot doubt that it
was sufficiently capacious to give to most of the citizens, poor
as well as rich, ample opportunity of profiting by these beautiful
compositions. At first, the admission to the theatre was gratuitous;
but as the crowd of strangers as well as freemen, was found both
excessive and disorderly, the system was adopted of asking a
price, seemingly at the time when the permanent theatre was put in
complete order after the destruction caused by Xerxes. The theatre
was let by contract to a manager, who engaged to defray, either
in whole or part, the habitual cost incurred by the state in the
representation, and who was allowed to sell tickets of admission.
At first, it appears that the price of tickets was not fixed, so
that the poor citizens were overbid, and could not get places.
Accordingly, Periklês introduced a new system, fixing the price of
places at three oboli, or half a drachma, for the better, and one
obolus for the less good. As there were two days of representation,
tickets covering both days were sold respectively for a drachma and
two oboli. But in order that the poor citizens might be enabled to
attend, two oboli were given out from the public treasure to each
citizen—rich as well as poor, if they chose to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_321">[p. 321]</span> receive it—on the occasion of the
festival. A poor man was thus furnished with the means of purchasing
his place and going to the theatre without cost, on both days, if he
chose; or, if he preferred it, he might go on one day only; or might
even stay away altogether, and spend both the two oboli in any other
manner. The higher price obtained for the better seats purchased by
the richer citizens, is here to be set against the sum disbursed to
the poorer; but we have no data before us for striking the balance,
nor can we tell how the finances of the state were affected by it.<a
id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Such was the original theôrikon, or festival-pay, introduced
by Periklês at Athens; a system of distributing the public money,
gradually extended to other festivals in which there was no
theatrical representation, and which in later times reached a
mischievous excess; having begun at a time when Athens was full of
money from foreign tribute, and continuing, with increased demand
at a subsequent time, when she was comparatively poor and without
extraneous resources. It is to be remembered that all these festivals
were portions of the ancient religion, and that, according to the
feelings of that time, cheerful and multitudinous assemblages were
essential to the satisfaction of the god in whose honor the festival
was celebrated. Such disbursements were a portion of the religious,
even more than of the civil establishment. Of the abusive excess
which they afterwards reached, however, I shall speak in a future
volume: at present, I deal with the theôrikon only in its primitive
function and effect, of enabling all Athenians indiscriminately to
witness the representation of the tragedies.</p>

<p>We cannot doubt that the effect of these compositions upon
the public sympathies, as well as upon the public judgment and
intelligence, must have been beneficial and moralizing in a high
degree. Though the subjects and persons are legendary, the relations
between them are all human and simple, exalted above the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> level of humanity
only in such measure as to present a stronger claim to the hearer’s
admiration or pity. So powerful a body of poetical influence has
probably never been brought to act upon the emotions of any other
population; and when we consider the extraordinary beauty of these
immortal compositions, which first stamped tragedy as a separate
department of poetry, and gave to it a dignity never since reached,
we shall be satisfied that the tastes, the sentiments, and the
intellectual standard, of the Athenian multitude, must have been
sensibly improved and exalted by such lessons. The reception of
such pleasures through the eye and the ear, as well as amidst a
sympathizing crowd, was a fact of no small importance in the mental
history of Athens. It contributed to exalt their imagination, like
the grand edifices and ornaments added during the same period to
their acropolis. Like them, too, and even more than they, tragedy was
the monopoly of Athens; for while tragic composers came thither from
other parts of Greece—Achæus from Eretria, and Ion from Chios, at a
time when the Athenian empire comprised both those places—to exhibit
their genius, nowhere else were original tragedies composed and
acted, though hardly any considerable city was without a theatre.<a
id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>The three great tragedians—Æschylus, Sophoklês, and
Euripidês—distinguished above all their competitors, as well by
contemporaries as by subsequent critics, are interesting to us,
not merely from the positive beauties of each, but also from the
differences between them in handling, style, and sentiment, and from
the manner in which these differences illustrate the insensible
modification of the Athenian mind. Though the subjects, persons, and
events of tragedy always continued to be borrowed from the legendary
world, and were thus kept above the level of contemporaneous life,<a
id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
yet the dramatic manner of handling them is sensibly modified, even
in Sophoklês as compared with Æschylus; and still more in Euripidês,
by the atmosphere of democracy, political and judicial contention,
and philosophy, encompassing and acting upon the poet.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span></p> <p>In Æschylus,
the ideality belongs to the handling not less than to the subjects:
the passions appealed to are the masculine and violent, to the
exclusion of Aphroditê and her inspirations:<a id="FNanchor_514"
href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> the figures are
vast and majestic, but exhibited only in half-light and in shadowy
outline: the speech is replete with bold metaphor and abrupt
transition, “grandiloquent even to a fault,” as Quintilian remarks,
and often approaching nearer to Oriental vagueness than to Grecian
perspicuity. In Sophoklês, there is evidently a closer approach
to reality and common life: the range of emotions is more varied,
the figures are more distinctly seen, and the action more fully
and conspicuously worked out. Not only we have a more elaborate
dramatic structure, but a more expanded dialogue, and a comparative
simplicity of speech like that of living Greeks: and we find too a
certain admixture of rhetorical declamation, amidst the greatest
poetical beauty which the Grecian drama ever attained. But when we
advance to Euripidês, this rhetorical element becomes still more
prominent and developed. The ultra-natural sublimity of the legendary
characters disappears: love and compassion are invoked to a degree
which Æschylus would have deemed inconsistent with the dignity of
the heroic person: moreover, there are appeals to the reason, and
argumentative controversies, which that grandiloquent poet would have
despised as petty and forensic cavils. And—what was worse still,
judging from the Æschylean point of view—there was a certain novelty
of speculation, an intimation of doubt on reigning opinions, and an
air of scientific refinement, often spoiling the poetical effect.</p>

<p>Such differences between these three great poets are doubtless
referable to the working of Athenian politics and Athenian philosophy
on the minds of the two later. In Sophoklês, we may trace the
companion of Herodotus;<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515"
class="fnanchor">[515]</a> in Euripidês, the hearer of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> Anaxagoras,
Sokratês, and Prodikus;<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516"
class="fnanchor">[516]</a> in both, the familiarity with that
wide-spread popularity of speech, and real, serious debate of
politicians and competitors before the dikastery, which both had ever
before their eyes, but which the genius of Sophoklês knew how to keep
in due subordination to his grand poetical purpose.</p>

<p>The transformation of the tragic muse from Æschylus to Euripidês
is the more deserving of notice, as it shows us how Attic tragedy
served as the natural prelude and encouragement to the rhetorical
and dialectical age which was approaching. But the democracy, which
thus insensibly modified the tragic drama, imparted a new life and
ampler proportions to the comic; both the one and the other being
stimulated by the increasing prosperity and power of Athens during
the half century following 480 <small>B.C.</small>
Not only was the affluence of strangers and visitors to Athens
continually augmenting, but wealthy men were easily found to incur
the expense of training the chorus and actors. There was no manner
of employing wealth which seemed so appropriate to procure influence
and popularity to its possessors, as that of contributing to
enhance the magnificence of the national and religious festivals.<a
id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
This was the general sentiment both among rich and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span> among poor; nor is
there any criticism more unfounded than that which represents such an
obligation as hard and oppressive upon rich men. Most of them spent
more than they were legally compelled to spend in this way, from the
desire of exalting their popularity. The only real sufferers were
the people, considered as interested in a just administration of
law; since it was a practice which enabled many rich men to acquire
importance who had no personal qualities to deserve it, and which
provided them with a stock of factitious merits to be pleaded before
the dikastery, as a set-off against substantive accusations.</p>

<p>The full splendor of the comic muse was considerably later than
that of the tragic. Even down to 460 <small>B.C.</small>
(about the time when Periklês and Ephialtês introduced their
constitutional reforms), there was not a single comic poet of
eminence at Athens; nor was there apparently a single undisputed
Athenian comedy before that date, which survived to the times of
the Alexandrine critics. Magnês, Kratês, and Kratinus—probably also
Chionidês and Ekphantidês<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518"
class="fnanchor">[518]</a>—all belong to the period beginning about
(Olympiad 80 or) 460 <small>B.C.</small>; that is, the
generation preceding Aristophanês, whose first composition dates
in 427 <small>B.C.</small> The condition and growth
of Attic comedy before this period seems to have been unknown
even to Aristotle, who intimates that the archon did not begin to
grant a chorus for comedy, or to number it among the authoritative
solemnities of the festival, until long after the practice had been
established for tragedy. Thus the comic chorus in that early time
consisted of volunteers, without any chorêgus publicly assigned to
bear the expense of teaching them or getting up the piece; so that
there was little motive for authors to bestow care or genius in the
preparation of their song, dance, and scurrilous monody, or dialogue.
The exuberant revelry of the phallic festival and procession, with
full license of scoffing at any one present, which the god Dionysus
was supposed to enjoy, and with the most plain-spoken grossness as
well in language as in ideas, formed the primitive germ, which under
Athenian genius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span>
ripened into the old comedy.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519"
class="fnanchor">[519]</a> It resembled in many respects the satyric
drama of the tragedians, but was distinguished from it by dealing
not merely with the ancient mythical stories and persons, but
chiefly with contemporary men and subjects of common life; dealing
with them often, too, under their real names, and with ridicule
the most direct, poignant, and scornful. We see clearly how fair a
field Athens would offer for this species of composition, at a time
when the bitterness of political contention ran high,—when the city
had become a centre for novelties from every part of Greece,—when
tragedians, rhetors, and philosophers, were acquiring celebrity and
incurring odium,—and when the democratical constitution laid open all
the details of political and judicial business, as well as all the
first men of the state, not merely to universal criticism, but also
to unmeasured libel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span></p>

<p>Out of all the once abundant compositions of Attic comedy,
nothing has reached us except eleven plays of Aristophanês. That
poet himself singles out Magnês, Kratês, and Kratinus, among
predecessors whom he describes as numerous, for honorable mention; as
having been frequently, though not uniformly, successful. Kratinus
appears to have been not only the most copious, but also the most
distinguished, among all those who preceded Aristophanês, a list
comprising Hermippus, Telekleidês, and the other bitter assailants
of Periklês. It was Kratinus who first extended and systematized
the license of the phallic festival, and the “careless laughter
of the festive crowd,”<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520"
class="fnanchor">[520]</a> into a drama of regular structure,
with actors three in number, according to the analogy of tragedy.
Standing forward, against particular persons exhibited or denounced
by their names, with a malignity of personal slander not inferior to
the iambist Archilochus, and with an abrupt and dithyrambic style
somewhat resembling Æschylus, Kratinus made an epoch in comedy as
the latter had made in tragedy; but was surpassed by Aristophanês,
as much as Æschylus had been surpassed by Sophoklês. We are
told that his compositions were not only more rudely bitter and
extensively libellous than those of Aristophanês,<a id="FNanchor_521"
href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> but also destitute
of that richness of illustration and felicity of expression which
pervades all the wit of the latter, whether good-natured or
malignant. In Kratinus, too, comedy first made herself felt as a
substantive agent and partisan in the political warfare of Athens.
He espoused the cause of Kimon against Periklês;<a id="FNanchor_522"
href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> eulogizing the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> former, while he
bitterly derided and vituperated the latter Hermippus, Telekleidês,
and most of the contemporary comic writers followed the same
political line in assailing that great man, together with those
personally connected with him, Aspasia and Anaxagoras: indeed,
Hermippus was the person who indicted Aspasia for impiety before the
dikastery. But the testimony of Aristophanês<a id="FNanchor_523"
href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> shows that no comic
writer, of the time of Periklês, equalled Kratinus, either in
vehemence of libel or in popularity.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, in 440 <small>B.C.</small>,
a law was passed forbidding comic authors to ridicule any citizen
by name in their compositions; which prohibition, however,
was rescinded after two years, an interval marked by the rare
phenomenon of a lenient comedy from Kratinus.<a id="FNanchor_524"
href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Such enactment
denotes a struggle in the Athenian mind, even at that time, against
the mischief of making the Dionysiac festival an occasion for
unmeasured libel against citizens publicly named and probably
themselves present. And there was another style of comedy taken up
by Kratês, distinct from the iambic or Archilochian vein worked
by Kratinus, in which comic incident was attached to fictitious
characters and woven into a story, without recourse to real
individual names or direct personality. This species of comedy,
analogous to that which Epicharmus had before exhibited at Syracuse,
was continued by Pherekratês as the successor of Kratês. Though for a
long time less popular and successful than the poignant food served
up by Kratinus and others, it became finally predominant after the
close of the Peloponnesian war, by the gradual transition of what is
called the Old Comedy into the Middle and New Comedy.</p>

<p>But it is in Aristophanês that the genius of the old libellous
comedy appears in its culminating perfection. At least we have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> before us enough of
his works to enable us to appreciate his merits; though perhaps
Eupolis, Ameipsias, Phrynichus, Plato (Comicus), and others, who
contended against him at the festivals with alternate victory and
defeat, would be found to deserve similar praise, if we possessed
their compositions. Never probably will the full and unshackled
force of comedy be so exhibited again. Without having Aristophanês
actually before us, it would have been impossible to imagine the
unmeasured and unsparing license of attack assumed by the old comedy
upon the gods, the institutions, the politicians, philosophers,
poets, private citizens specially named, and even the women, whose
life was entirely domestic, of Athens. With this universal liberty
in respect of subject, there is combined a poignancy of derision
and satire, a fecundity of imagination and variety of turns, and
a richness of poetical expression, such as cannot be surpassed,
and such as fully explains the admiration expressed for him by the
philosopher Plato, who in other respects must have regarded him
with unquestionable disapprobation. His comedies are popular in the
largest sense of the word, addressed to the entire body of male
citizens on a day consecrated to festivity, and providing for them
amusement or derision with a sort of drunken abundance, out of all
persons or things standing in any way prominent before the public
eye. The earliest comedy of Aristophanês was exhibited in 427 <small>B.C.</small>, and his muse continued for a long time
prolific, since two of the dramas now remaining belong to an epoch
eleven years after the Thirty and the renovation of the democracy,
about 392 <small>B.C.</small> After that renovation,
however, as I have before remarked, the unmeasured sweep and
libellous personality of the old comedy was gradually discontinued:
the comic chorus was first cut down, and afterwards suppressed, so as
to usher in what is commonly termed the Middle Comedy, without any
chorus at all. The “Plutus” of Aristophanês indicates some approach
to this new phase; but his earlier and more numerous comedies, from
the “Acharneis,” in 425 <small>B.C.</small> to the
“Frogs,” in 405 <small>B.C.</small>, only a few months
before the fatal battle of Ægospotami, exhibit the continuous,
unexhausted, untempered flow of the stream first opened by
Kratinus.</p>

<p>Such abundance both of tragic and comic poetry, each of first-rate
excellence, formed one of the marked features of Athenian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span> life, and became a
powerful instrument in popularizing new combinations of thought
with variety and elegance of expression. While the tragic muse
presented the still higher advantage of inspiring elevated and
benevolent sympathies, more was probably lost than gained by the
lessons of the comic muse; not only bringing out keenly all that was
really ludicrous or contemptible in the phenomena of the day, but
manufacturing scornful laughter, quite as often, out of that which
was innocent or even meritorious, as well as out of boundless private
slander. The “Knights” and the “Wasps” of Aristophanês, however, not
to mention other plays, are a standing evidence of one good point in
the Athenian character; that they bore with good-natured indulgence
the full outpouring of ridicule and even of calumny interwoven with
it, upon those democratical institutions to which they were sincerely
attached. The democracy was strong enough to tolerate unfriendly
tongues either in earnest or in jest: the reputations of men who
stood conspicuously forward in politics, on whatever side, might also
be considered as a fair mark for attacks; inasmuch as that measure of
aggressive criticism which is tutelary and indispensable, cannot be
permitted without the accompanying evil, comparatively much smaller,
of excess and injustice;<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525"
class="fnanchor">[525]</a> though even here we may remark that
excess of bitter personality is among the most conspicuous sins of
Athenian literature generally. But the warfare of comedy, in the
persons of Aristophanês and other composers, against philosophy,
literature, and eloquence, in the name of those good old times of
ignorance, “when an Athenian seaman knew nothing more than how to
call for his barley-cake, and cry, Yo-ho;”<a id="FNanchor_526"
href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> and the retrograde spirit which
induces them to exhibit moral turpitude as the natural consequence
of the intellectual progress of the age, are circumstances going far
to prove an unfavorable and degrading influence of comedy on the
Athenian mind.</p>

<p>In reference to individual men, and to Sokratês<a
id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
especially, the Athenians seem to have been unfavorably biased by
the misapplied wit and genius of Aristophanês, in “The Clouds,”
aided by other comedies of Eupolis, and Ameipsias and Eupolis; but
on the general march of politics, philosophy, or letters, these
composers had little influence. Nor were they ever regarded at
Athens in the light in which they are presented to us by modern
criticism; as men of exalted morality, stern patriotism, and genuine
discernment of the true interests of their country; as animated
by large and steady views of improving their fellow-citizens, but
compelled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> in
consequence of prejudice or opposition, to disguise a far-sighted
political philosophy under the veil of satire; as good judges of
the most debatable questions, such as the prudence of making war
or peace, and excellent authority to guide us in appreciating the
merits or demerits of their contemporaries, insomuch that the victims
of their lampoons are habitually set down as worthless men.<a
id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
There cannot be a greater misconception of the old comedy<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span> than to regard it
in this point of view; yet it is astonishing how many subsequent
writers, from Diodorus and Plutarch down to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> the present day, have thought
themselves entitled to deduce their facts of Grecian history, and
their estimate of Grecian men, events, and institutions, from the
comedies of Aristophanês. Standing pre-eminent as the latter does in
comic genius, his point of view is only so much the more determined
by the ludicrous associations suggested to his fancy, so that he thus
departs the more widely from the conditions of a faithful witness or
candid critic. He presents himself to provoke the laugh, mirthful
or spiteful, of the festival crowd, assembled for the gratification
of these emotions, and not with any expectation of serious or
reasonable impressions.<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529"
class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Nor does he at all conceal how much
he is mortified by failure; like the professional jester, or
“laughter-maker,” at the banquets of rich Athenian citizens;<a
id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
the parallel of Aristophanês as to purpose, however unworthy of
comparison in every other respect.</p>

<p>This rise and development of dramatic poetry in Greece—so
abundant, so varied, and so rich in genius—belongs to the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small> It had been in the
preceding century nothing more than an unpretending graft upon
the primitive chorus, and was then even denounced by Solon, or in
the dictum ascribed to Solon, as a vicious novelty, tending—by
its simulation of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p.
335]</span> false character, and by its effusion of sentiments not
genuine or sincere—to corrupt the integrity of human dealings;<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> a
charge of corruption, not unlike that which Aristophanês worked up,
a century afterwards, in his “Clouds,” against physics, rhetoric,
and dialectics, in the person of Sokratês. But the properties of the
graft had overpowered and subordinated those of the original stem;
so that dramatic poetry was now a distinct form, subject to laws
of its own, and shining with splendor equal, if not superior, to
the elegiac, choric, lyric, and epic poetry which constituted the
previous stock of the Grecian world.</p>

<p>Such transformations in the poetry, or, to speak more justly, in
the literature—for before the year 500 <small>B.C.</small> the two
expressions were equivalent—of Greece, were at once products, marks,
and auxiliaries, in the expansion of the national mind. Our minds
have now become familiar with dramatic combinations, which have
ceased to be peculiar to any special form or conditions of political
society. But if we compare the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>
with that which preceded it, the recently born drama will be seen to
have been a most important and impressive novelty: and so assuredly
it would have been regarded by Solon, the largest mind of his own
age, if he could have risen again, a century and a quarter after his
death, to witness the Antigonê of Sophoklês, the Medea of Euripidês,
or the Acharneis of Aristophanês.</p>

<p>Its novelty does not consist merely in the high order of
imagination and judgment required for the construction of a drama
at once regular and effective. This, indeed, is no small addition
to Grecian poetical celebrity as it stood in the days of Solon,
Alkæus, Sappho, and Stesichorus: but we must remember that the
epical structure of the Odyssey, so ancient and long acquired to
the Hellenic world, implies a reach of architectonic talent quite
equal to that exhibited in the most symmetrical drama of Sophoklês.
The great innovation of the dramatists consisted in the rhetorical,
the dialectical, and the ethical spirit which they breathed into
their poetry. Of all this, the undeveloped germ doubtless existed
in the previous epic, lyric, and gnomic composition; but the
drama stood distinguished from all three by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> bringing it out into conspicuous
amplitude, and making it the substantive means of effect. Instead
of recounting exploits achieved, or sufferings undergone by the
heroes,—instead of pouring out his own single-minded impressions in
reference to some given event or juncture,—the tragic poet produces
the mythical persons themselves to talk, discuss, accuse, defend,
confute, lament, threaten, advise, persuade, or appease; among
one another, but before the audience. In the <i>drama</i>, a singular
misnomer, nothing is actually done: all is talk; assuming what is
done, as passing, or as having passed, elsewhere. The dramatic
poet, speaking continually, but at each moment through a different
character, carries on the purpose of each of his characters by
words calculated to influence the other characters, and appropriate
to each successive juncture. Here are rhetorical exigencies
from beginning to end:<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532"
class="fnanchor">[532]</a> while, since the whole interest of the
piece turns upon some contention or struggle carried on by speech;
since debate, consultation, and retort, never cease; since every
character, good or evil, temperate or violent, must be supplied
with suitable language to defend his proceedings, to attack or
repel opponents, and generally to make good the relative importance
assigned to him, here again dialectical skill in no small degree is
indispensable.</p>

<p>Lastly, the strength and variety of ethical sentiment infused into
the Grecian tragedy, is among the most remarkable characteristics
which distinguish it from the anterior forms of poetry. “To do or
suffer terrible things,” is pronounced by Aristotle to be its proper
subject-matter; and the internal mind and motives of the doer or
sufferer, on which the ethical interest fastens, are laid open by
the Greek tragedians with an impressive minuteness which neither the
epic nor the lyric could possibly parallel. Moreover, the appropriate
subject-matter of tragedy is pregnant not only with ethical
sympathy, but also with ethical debate and speculation. Characters
of mixed good and evil; distinct rules of duty, one conflicting
with the other; wrong done, and justified to the conscience of the
doer, if not to that of the spectator, by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> previous wrong suffered, all these
are the favorite themes of Æschylus and his two great successors.
Klytæmnestra kills her husband Agamemnôn on his return from Troy:
her defence is, that he had deserved this treatment at her hands
for having sacrificed his own and her daughter, Iphigeneia. Her son
Orestês kills her, under a full conviction of the duty of avenging
his father, and even under the sanction of Apollo. The retributive
Eumenides pursue him for the deed, and Æschylus brings all the
parties before the court of Areopagus, with Athênê as president,
where the case is fairly argued, with the Eumenides as accusers,
and Apollo as counsel for the prisoner, and ends by an equality of
votes in the court: upon which Athênê gives her casting-vote to
absolve Orestês. Again; let any man note the conflicting obligations
which Sophoklês so forcibly brings out in his beautiful drama of the
Antigonê. Kreon directs that the body of Polyneikês, as a traitor
and recent invader of the country, shall remain unburied: Antigonê,
sister of Polyneikês, denounces such interdict as impious, and
violates it, under an overruling persuasion of fraternal duty. Kreon
having ordered her to be buried alive, his youthful son Hæmon, her
betrothed lover, is plunged into a heart-rending conflict between
abhorrence of such cruelty on the one side, and submission to his
father on the other. Sophoklês sets forth both these contending
rules of duty in an elaborate scene of dialogue between the father
and the son. Here are two rules both sacred and respectable, but
the one of which cannot be observed without violating the other.
Since a choice must be made, which of the two ought a good man to
obey? This is a point which the great poet is well pleased to leave
undetermined. But if there be any among the audience in whom the
least impulse of intellectual speculation is alive, he will by no
means leave it so, without some mental effort to solve the problem,
and to discover some grand and comprehensive principle from whence
all the moral rules emanate; a principle such as may instruct his
conscience in those cases generally, of not unfrequent occurrence,
wherein two obligations conflict with each other. The tragedian not
only appeals more powerfully to the ethical sentiment than poetry had
ever done before, but also, by raising these grave and touch<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>ing questions, addresses
a stimulus and challenge to the intellect, spurring it on to ethical
speculation.</p>

<p>Putting all these points together, we see how much wider was the
intellectual range of tragedy, and how considerable is the mental
progress which it betokens, as compared with the lyric and gnomic
poetry, or with the Seven Wise Men and their authoritative aphorisms,
which formed the glory, and marked the limit, of the preceding
century. In place of unexpanded results, or the mere communication
of single-minded sentiment, we have even in Æschylus, the earliest
of the great tragedians, a large latitude of dissent and debate, a
shifting point of view, a case better or worse, made out for distinct
and contending parties, and a divination of the future advent of
sovereign and instructed reason. It was through the intermediate
stage of tragedy that Grecian literature passed into the rhetoric,
dialectics, and ethical speculation, which marked the fifth century
<small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>Other simultaneous causes, arising directly out of the business
of real life, contributed to the generation of these same capacities
and studies. The fifth century <small>B.C.</small> is
the first century of democracy at Athens, in Sicily, and elsewhere:
moreover, at that period, beginning from the Ionic revolt and
the Persian invasions of Greece, the political relations between
one Grecian city and another became more complicated, as well as
more continuous; requiring a greater measure of talent in the
public men who managed them. Without some power of persuading or
confuting,—of defending himself against accusation, or in case of
need, accusing others,—no man could possibly hold an ascendent
position. He had probably not less need of this talent for private,
informal, conversations to satisfy his own political partisans,
than for addressing the public assembly formally convoked. Even as
commanding an army or a fleet, without any laws of war or habits of
professional discipline, his power of keeping up the good-humor,
confidence, and prompt obedience of his men, depended not a little
on his command of speech.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533"
class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Nor was it only to the leaders in
political life that such an accomplishment was indispensable.
In all the democracies,—and probably in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> several governments which were not
democracies, but oligarchies of an open character,—the courts of
justice were more or less numerous, and the procedure oral and
public: in Athens, especially, the dikasteries—whose constitution
has been explained in a former chapter—were both very numerous,
and paid for attendance. Every citizen had to go before them in
person, without being able to send a paid advocate in his place,
if he either required redress for wrong offered to himself, or was
accused of wrong by another.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534"
class="fnanchor">[534]</a> There was no man, therefore, who might not
be cast or condemned, or fail in his own suit, even with right on his
side, unless he possessed some powers of speech to unfold his case to
the dikasts, as well as to confute the falsehoods, and disentangle
the sophistry, of an opponent. Moreover, to any man of known family
and station, it would be a humiliation hardly less painful than the
loss of the cause, to stand before the dikastery with friends and
enemies around him, and find himself unable to carry on the thread of
a discourse without halting or confusion. To meet such liabilities,
from which no citizen, rich or poor, was exempt, a certain training
in speech became not less essential than a certain training in
arms. Without the latter, he could not do his duty as an hoplite in
the ranks for the defence of his country; without the former, he
could not escape danger to his fortune or honor, and humiliation
in the eyes of his friends, if called before a dikastery, nor lend
assistance to any of those friends who might be placed under the like
necessity.</p>

<p>Here then were ample motives, arising out of practical prudence
not less than from the stimulus of ambition, to cultivate the power
both of continuous harangue, and of concise argumentation, or
interrogation and reply:<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a> motives for all, to acquire a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> certain moderate
aptitude in the use of these weapons; for the ambitious few, to
devote much labor and to shine as accomplished orators.</p>

<p>Such political and social motives, it is to be remembered,
though acting very forcibly at Athens, were by no means peculiar to
Athens, but prevailed more or less throughout a large portion of
the Grecian cities, especially in Sicily, when all the governments
became popularized after the overthrow of the Gelonian dynasty. And
it was in Sicily and Italy, that the first individuals arose, who
acquired permanent name both in rhetoric and dialectics: Empedoklês
of Agrigentum in the former; Zeno of Elea, in Italy, in the latter.<a
id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Both these distinguished men bore a conspicuous part in
politics, and both on the popular side; Empedoklês against an
oligarchy, Zeno against a despot. But both also were yet more
distinguished as philosophers, and the dialectical impulse in
Zeno, if not the rhetorical impulse in Empedoklês, came more
from his philosophy than from his politics. Empedoklês (about
470-440 <small>B.C.</small>) appears to have held
intercourse at least, if not partial communion of doctrine, with
the dispersed philosophers of the Pythagorean league; the violent
subversion of which, at Kroton and elsewhere, I have related in
a previous chapter.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a> He constructed a system of physics and
cosmogony, distinguished for first broaching the doctrine of the
Four elements, and set forth in a poem composed by himself: besides
which he seems to have had much of the mystical tone and miraculous
pretensions of Pythagoras; professing not only to cure pestilence
and other distempers, but to teach how old age might be averted and
the dead raised from Hades; to prophesy, and to raise and calm the
winds at his pleasure. Gorgias, his pupil, deposed to having been
present at the magical ceremonies of Empedoklês.<a id="FNanchor_538"
href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span> impressive character of
his poem is sufficiently attested by the admiration of Lucretius,<a
id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
and the rhetoric ascribed to him may have consisted mainly in oral
teaching or exposition of the same doctrines. Tisias and Korax of
Syracuse, who are also mentioned as the first teachers of rhetoric,
and the first who made known any precepts about the rhetorical
practice, were his contemporaries; and the celebrated Gorgias was his
pupil.</p>

<p id="Zeno">The dialectical movement emanated at the same time
from the Eleatic school of philosophers,—Zeno, and his contemporary
the Samian Melissus, 460-440,—if not from their common teacher
Parmenidês. Melissus also, as well as Zeno and Empedoklês, was a
distinguished citizen as well as a philosopher; having been in
command of the Samian fleet at the time of the revolt from Athens,
and having in that capacity gained a victory over the Athenians.</p>

<p>All the philosophers of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>,
prior to Sokratês, inheriting from their earliest poetical
predecessors the vast and unmeasured problems which had once
been solved by the supposition of divine or superhuman agents,
contemplated the world, physical and moral, all in a mass,
and applied their minds to find some hypothesis which would
give them an explanation of this totality,<a id="FNanchor_540"
href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> or at least appease
curiosity by something which looked like an explanation. What were
the elements out of which sensible things were made? What was the
initial cause or principle of those changes which appeared to our
senses? What was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span>
change?—was it generation of something integrally new and destruction
of something preëxistent,—or was it a decomposition and recombination
of elements still continuing. The theories of the various Ionic
philosophers, and of Empedoklês after them, admitting one, two, or
four elementary substances, with Friendship and Enmity to serve as
causes of motion or change; the Homœomeries of Anaxagoras, with
Nous, or Intelligence, as the stirring and regularizing agent; the
atoms and void of Leukippus and Demokritus, all these were different
hypotheses answering to a similar vein of thought. All of them,
though assuming that the sensible appearances of things were delusive
and perplexing, nevertheless, were borrowed more or less directly
from some of these appearances, which were employed to explain and
illustrate the whole theory, and served to render it plausible when
stated as well as to defend it against attack. But the philosophers
of the Eleatic school—first Xenophanês, and after him Parmenidês—took
a distinct path of their own. To find that which was real, and which
lay as it were concealed behind or under the delusive phenomena of
sense, they had recourse only to mental abstractions. They supposed a
Substance or Something not perceivable by sense, but only cogitable
or conceivable by reason; a One and All, continuous and finite,
which was not only real and self-existent, but was the only reality;
eternal, immovable, and unchangeable, and the only matter knowable.
The phenomena of sense, which began and ended one after the other,
they thought, were essentially delusive, uncertain, contradictory
among themselves, and open to endless diversity of opinion.<a
id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
Upon these, nevertheless, they announced an opinion; adopting two
elements, heat and cold, or light and darkness.</p>

<p>Parmenidês set forth this doctrine of the One and All in a poem,
of which but a few fragments now remain, so that we understand very
imperfectly the positive arguments employed to recommend it. The
matter of truth and knowledge, such as he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span> alone admitted, was altogether
removed from the senses and divested of sensible properties, so
as to be conceived only as an Ens Rationis, and described and
discussed only in the most general words of the language. The
exposition given by Parmenidês in his poem,<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> though complimented
by Plato, was vehemently controverted by others, who deduced
from it many contradictions and absurdities. As a part of his
reply, and doubtless the strongest part, Parmenidês retorted
upon his adversaries; an example followed by his pupil Zeno with
still greater acuteness and success. Those who controverted his
ontological theory, that the real, ultra-phenomenal substance was
One, affirmed it to be not One, but Many; divisible, movable,
changeable, etc. Zeno attacked this latter theory, and proved that
it led to contradictions and absurdities still greater than those
involved in the proposition of Parmenidês.<a id="FNanchor_543"
href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> He impugned
the testimony of sense, affirming that it furnished premises
for conclusions which contradicted each other, and that it was
unworthy of trust.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544"
class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Parmenidês<a id="FNanchor_545"
href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> had denied that
there was any such thing as real change either of place or color:
Zeno maintained change of place, or motion, to be impossible and
self-contradictory; propounding many logical difficulties, derived
from the infinite divisibility of matter, against some of the most
obvious affirmations respecting sensible phenomena. Melissus appears
to have argued in a vein similar to that of Zeno, though with much
less acuteness; demonstrating indirectly the doctrine of Parmenidês,
by deducing impossible inferences from the contrary hypothesis.<a
id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span></p>

<p>Zeno published a treatise to maintain the thesis above described,
which he also upheld by personal conversations and discussions,
in a manner doubtless far more efficacious than his writing; the
oral teaching of these early philosophers being their really
impressive manifestation. His subtle dialectic arguments were not
only sufficient to occupy all the philosophers of antiquity, in
confuting them more or less successfully, but have even descended
to modern times as a fire not yet extinguished.<a id="FNanchor_547"
href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> The great effect
produced among the speculative minds of Greece by his writing and
conversation, is attested both by Plato and Aristotle. He visited
Athens, gave instruction to some eminent Athenians, for high pay, and
is said to have conversed both with Periklês and with Sokratês, at a
time when the latter was very young; probably between 450-440 <small>B.C.</small><a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548"
class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span></p>

<p>His appearance constitutes a remarkable era in Grecian philosophy,
because he first brought out the extraordinary aggressive or negative
force of the dialectic method. In this discussion respecting the One
and the Many, positive grounds on either side were alike scanty: each
party had to set forth the contradictions deducible from the opposite
hypothesis, and Zeno professed to show that those of his opponents
were the more flagrant. We thus see that, along with the methodized
question and answer, or dialectic method, employed from henceforward
more and more in philosophical inquiries, comes out at the same time
the negative tendency, the probing, testing, and scrutinizing force,
of Grecian speculation. The negative side of Grecian speculation
stands quite as prominently marked, and occupies as large a measure
of the intellectual force of their philosophers, as the positive
side. It is not simply to arrive at a conclusion, sustained by a
certain measure of plausible premise,—and then to proclaim it as an
authoritative dogma, silencing or disparaging all objectors,—that
Grecian speculation aspires. To unmask not only positive falsehood,
but even affirmation without evidence, exaggerated confidence in what
was only doubtful, and show of knowledge without the reality; to
look at a problem on all sides, and set forth all the difficulties
attending its solution, to take account of deductions from the
affirmative evidence, even in the case of conclusions accepted as
true upon the balance, all this will be found pervading the march
of their greatest thinkers. As a condition of all progressive
philosophy, it is not less essential that the grounds of negation
should be freely exposed, than the grounds of affirmation. We shall
find the two going hand in hand, and the negative vein, indeed, the
more impressive and characteristic of the two, from Zeno downwards in
our history. In one of the earliest memoranda illustrative of Grecian
dialectics,—the sentences in which Plato represents Parmenidês and
Zeno as bequeathing their mantle to the youthful Sokratês, and
giving him precepts for successfully prosecuting those researches
which his marked inquisitive impulse promised,—this large and
comprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span>
point of view is emphatically inculcated. He is admonished to set
before him both sides of every hypothesis, and to follow out both
the negative and the affirmative chains of argument with equal
perseverance and equal freedom of scrutiny; neither daunted by the
adverse opinions around him, nor deterred by sneers against wasting
time in fruitless talk; since the multitude are ignorant that
without thus travelling round all sides of a question, no assured
comprehension of the truth is attainable.<a id="FNanchor_549"
href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>We thus find ourselves, from the year 450 <small>B.C.</small>, downwards, in presence of two important
classes of men in Greece, unknown to Solon or even to Kleisthenês,
the Rhetoricians, and the Dialecticians; for whom, as has been shown,
the ground had been gradually prepared by the politics, the poetry,
and the speculation, of the preceding period.</p>

<p>Both these two novelties—like the poetry and other accomplishments
of this memorable race—grew up from rude indigenous beginnings,
under native stimulus unborrowed and unassisted from without. The
rhetorical teaching was an attempt to assist and improve men in the
power of continuous speech as addressed to assembled numbers, such as
the public assembly or the dikastery; it was therefore a species of
training sought for by men of active pursuits and ambition, either
that they might succeed in public life, or that they might maintain
their rights and dignity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p.
347]</span> if called before the court of justice. On the other hand,
the dialectic business had no direct reference to public life, to
the judicial pleading, or to any assembled large number. It was a
dialogue carried on by two disputants, usually before a few hearers,
to unravel some obscurity, to reduce the respondent to silence and
contradiction, to exercise both parties in mastery of the subject,
or to sift the consequences of some problematical assumption. It was
spontaneous conversation<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550"
class="fnanchor">[550]</a> systematized and turned into some
predetermined channel; furnishing a stimulus to thought, and a
means of improvement not attainable in any other manner; furnishing
to some, also, a source of profit or display. It opened a line of
serious intellectual pursuit to men of a speculative or inquisitive
turn, who were deficient in voice, in boldness, in continuous memory,
for public speaking; or who desired to keep themselves apart from the
political and judicial animosities of the moment.</p>

<p>Although there were numerous Athenians, who combined, in various
proportions, speculative with practical study, yet generally
speaking, the two veins of intellectual movement—one towards
active public business, the other towards enlarged opinions and
greater command of speculative truth, with its evidences—continued
simultaneous and separate. There subsisted between them a standing
polemical controversy and a spirit of mutual detraction. If Plato
despised the sophists and the rhetors, Isokratês thinks himself
not less entitled to disparage those who employed their time in
debating upon the unity or plurality of virtue.<a id="FNanchor_551"
href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Even among
different teachers, in the same intellectual walk, also, there
prevailed but too often an acrimonious feeling of personal rivalry,
which laid them all so much the more open<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span> to assault from the common enemy of
all mental progress; a feeling of jealous ignorance, stationary or
wistfully retrospective, of no mean force at Athens, as in every
other society, and of course blended at Athens with the indigenous
democratical sentiment. This latter sentiment<a id="FNanchor_552"
href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> of antipathy to
new ideas, and new mental accomplishments, has been raised into
factitious importance by the comic genius of Aristophanês, whose
point of view modern authors have too often accepted; thus allowing
some of the worst feelings of Grecian antiquity to influence their
manner of conceiving the facts. Moreover, they have rarely made any
allowance for that force of literary and philosophical antipathy,
which was no less real and constant at Athens than the political; and
which made the different literary classes or individuals perpetually
unjust one towards another.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553"
class="fnanchor">[553]</a> It was the blessing and the glory of
Athens, that every man could speak out his sentiments and his
criticisms with a freedom unparalleled in the ancient world, and
hardly paralleled even in the modern, in which a vast body of dissent
both is, and always has been, condemned to absolute silence. But
this known latitude of censure ought to have imposed on modern
authors a peremptory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p.
349]</span> necessity of not accepting implicitly the censure of
any one, where the party inculpated has left no defence; at the
very least, of construing the censure strictly, and allowing for
the point of view from which it proceeds. From inattention to this
necessity, almost all the things and persons of Grecian history are
presented to us on their bad side; the libels of Aristophanês, the
sneers of Plato and Xenophon, even the interested generalities of a
plaintiff or defendant before the dikastery, are received with little
cross-examination as authentic materials for history.</p>

<p>If ever there was need to invoke this rare sentiment of candor,
it is when we come to discuss the history of the persons called
sophists, who now for the first time appear as of note; the
practical teachers of Athens and of Greece, misconceived as well as
misesteemed.</p>

<p>The primitive education at Athens consisted of two branches;
gymnastics, for the body; music, for the mind. The word <i>music</i>
is not to be judged according to the limited signification which
it now bears. It comprehended, from the beginning, everything
appertaining to the province of the Nine Muses; not merely learning
the use of the lyre, or how to bear part in a chorus; but also
the hearing, learning, and repeating, of poetical compositions,
as well as the practice of exact and elegant pronunciation; which
latter accomplishment, in a language like the Greek, with long
words, measured syllables, and great diversity of accentuation
between one word and another, must have been far more difficult
to acquire than it is in any modern European language. As the
range of ideas enlarged, so the words <i>music</i> and musical teachers
acquired an expanded meaning, so as to comprehend matter of
instruction at once ampler and more diversified. During the middle
of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, at Athens,
there came thus to be found, among the musical teachers, men of
the most distinguished abilities and eminence; masters of all the
learning and accomplishments of the age, teaching what was known
of astronomy, geography, and physics, and capable of holding
dialectical discussions with their pupils, upon all the various
problems then afloat among intellectual men. Of this character were
Lamprus, Agathoklês, Pythokleidês, Damon, etc. The two latter were
instructors of Periklês; and Damon was even rendered so unpopular
at Athens, partly by his large and free speculations, partly<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span> through the political
enemies of his great pupil, that he was ostracized, or at least
sentenced to banishment.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554"
class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Such men were competent companions for
Anaxagoras and Zeno, and employed in part on the same studies; the
field of acquired knowledge being not then large enough to be divided
into separate, exclusive compartments. While Euripidês frequented the
company, and acquainted himself with the opinions, of Anaxagoras, Ion
of Chios, his rival as a tragic poet, as well as the friend of Kimon,
bestowed so much thought upon physical subjects, as then conceived,
that he set up a theory of his own, propounding the doctrine of
three elements in nature;<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555"
class="fnanchor">[555]</a> air, fire, and earth.</p>

<p>Now such musical teachers as Damon and the others above
mentioned, were sophists, not merely in the natural and proper
Greek sense of that word, but, to a certain extent, even in the
special and restricted meaning which Plato afterwards thought
proper to confer upon it.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556"
class="fnanchor">[556]</a> A sophist, in the genuine sense of the
word, was a wise man, a clever man; one who stood prominently
before the public as distinguished for intellect or talent of some
kind. Thus Solon and Pythagoras are both called sophists;<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> Thamyras the skilful
bard, is called a sophist:<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557"
class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Sokratês is so denominated, not
merely by Aristophanês, but by Æschinês:<a id="FNanchor_558"
href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Aristotle
himself calls Aristippus, and Xenophon calls Antisthenês, both
of them disciples of Sokratês, by that name:<a id="FNanchor_559"
href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Xenophon,<a
id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
in describing a collection of instructive books, calls them “the
writings of the old poets and sophists,” meaning by the latter
word prose-writers generally: Plato is alluded to as a sophist,
even by Isokratês:<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561"
class="fnanchor">[561]</a> Isokratês himself was harshly criticized
as a sophist, and defends both himself and his profession:
lastly, Timon, the friend and admirer of Pyrrho, about 300-280
<small>B.C.</small>, who bitterly satirized all
the philosophers, designated them all, including Plato and
Aristotle, by the general name of sophists.<a id="FNanchor_562"
href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span> In this large and comprehensive
sense the word was originally used, and always continued to be so
understood among the general public. But along with this idea,
the title sophist also carried with it or connoted a certain
invidious feeling. The natural temper of a people generally ignorant
towards superior intellect,—the same temper which led to those
charges of magic so frequent in the Middle Ages,—appears to be a
union of admiration with something of an unfavorable sentiment;<a
id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
dislike, or apprehension, as the case may be, unless where the latter
element has become neutralized by habitual respect for an established
profession or station: at any rate, the unfriendly sentiment is so
often intended, that a substantive word, in which it is implied
without the necessity of any annexed predicate, is soon found
convenient. Timon, who hated the philosophers, thus found the word
sophist exactly suitable, in sentiment as well as meaning, to his
purpose in addressing them.</p>

<p>Now when (in the period succeeding 450 <small>B.C.</small>) the rhetorical and musical teachers came
to stand before the public at Athens in such increased eminence,
they of course, as well as other men intellectually celebrated,
became designated by the appropriate name of sophists. But there was
one characteristic peculiar to themselves, whereby they drew upon
themselves a double measure of that invidious sentiment which lay
wrapped up in the name. They taught for pay: of course, therefore,
the most eminent among them taught only the rich, and earned large
sums; a fact naturally provocative of envy, to some extent, among
the many who benefited nothing by them, but still more among the
inferior members of their own profession. But even great minds, like
Sokratês and Plato, though much superior to any such envy, cherished
in that age a genuine and vehement repugnance against receiving pay
for teaching. We read in Xen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p.
353]</span>ophon,<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564"
class="fnanchor">[564]</a> that Sokratês considered such a bargain
as nothing less than servitude, robbing the teacher of all free
choice as to persons or proceeding; and that he assimilated the
relation between teacher and pupil to that between two lovers or
two intimate friends; which was thoroughly dishonored, robbed of
its charm and reciprocity, and prevented from bringing about its
legitimate reward of attachment and devotion, by the intervention
of money payment. However little in harmony with modern ideas, such
was the conscientious sentiment of Sokratês and Plato; who therefore
considered the name sophists, denoting intellectual celebrity
combined with an odious association, as preëminently suitable to
the leading teachers for pay. The splendid genius, the lasting
influence, and the reiterated polemics, of Plato, have stamped it
upon the men against whom he wrote as if it were their recognized,
legitimate, and peculiar designation: though it is certain, that
if, in the middle of the Peloponnesian war, any Athenian had been
asked, “Who are the principal sophists in your city?” he would
have named Sokratês among the first; for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span> Sokratês was at once eminent as
an intellectual teacher and personally unpopular, not because
he received pay, but on other grounds, which will be hereafter
noticed: and this was the precise combination of qualities which the
general public naturally expressed by a sophist. Moreover, Plato
not only stole the name out of general circulation, in order to
fasten it specially upon his opponents, the paid teachers, but also
connected with it express discreditable attributes, which formed no
part of its primitive and recognized meaning, and were altogether
distinct from, though grafted upon, the vague sentiment of dislike
associated with it. Aristotle, following the example of his master,
gave to the word sophist a definition substantially the same as
that which it bears in the modern languages:<a id="FNanchor_565"
href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> “an impostrous
pretender to knowledge; a man who employs what he knows to be
fallacy, for the purpose of deceit and of getting money.” And he
did this at a time when he himself, with his estimable contemporary
Isokratês, were considered at Athens to come under the designation of
sophists, and were called so by every one who disliked either their
profession or their persons.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566"
class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>Great thinkers and writers, like Plato and Aristotle, have full
right to define and employ words in a sense of their own, provided
they give due notice. But it is essential that the reader<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> should keep in mind
the consequences of such change, and not mistake a word used in
a new sense for a new fact or phenomenon. The age with which
we are now dealing, the last half of the fifth century <small>B.C.</small>, is commonly distinguished in the history
of philosophy as the age of Sokratês and the sophists. The sophists
are spoken of as a new class of men, or sometimes in language which
implies a new doctrinal sect, or school, as if they then sprang up
in Greece for the first time; ostentatious imposters, flattering
and duping the rich youth for their own personal gain; undermining
the morality of Athens, public and private, and encouraging their
pupils to the unscrupulous prosecution of ambition and cupidity.
They are even affirmed to have succeeded in corrupting the general
morality, so that Athens had become miserably degenerated and vicious
in the latter years of the Peloponnesian war, as compared with what
she was in the time of Miltiadês and Aristeidês. Sokratês, on the
contrary, is usually described as a holy man combating and exposing
these false prophets, standing up as the champion of morality against
their insidious artifices.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567"
class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Now though the appearance of a man so
very original as Sokratês was a new fact of unspeakable importance,
the appearance of the sophists was no new fact; what was new was
the peculiar use of an old word, which Plato took out of its usual
meaning, and fastened upon the eminent paid teachers of the Sokratic
age.</p>

<p>The paid teachers, with whom, under the name of The Sophists,
he brings Sokratês into controversy, were Protagoras of Abdêra,
Gorgias of Leontini, Polus of Agrigentum, Hippias of Elis, Prodikus
of Keos, Thrasymachus of Chalkêdon, Euthydêmus and Dionysodorus of
Chios; to whom Xenophon adds Antiphon of Athens. These men—whom
modern writers set down as the sophists, and denounce as the moral
pestilence of their age—were not distinguished in any marked or
generic way from their predecessors. Their vocation was to train
up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> youth for the
duties, the pursuits, and the successes, of active life, both private
and public. Others had done this before; but these teachers brought
to the task a larger range of knowledge with a greater multiplicity
of scientific and other topics; not only more impressive powers of
composition and speech, serving as a personal example to the pupil,
but also a comprehension of the elements of good speaking, so as to
be able to give him precepts conducive to that accomplishment;<a
id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> a
considerable treasure of accumulated thought on moral and political
subjects, calculated to make their conversation very instructive,
and discourse ready prepared, on general heads or <i>common
places</i>, for their pupils to learn by heart.<a id="FNanchor_569"
href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> But this, though
a very important extension, was nothing more than an extension,
differing merely in degree of that which Damon and others had done
before them. It arose from the increased demand which had grown up
among the Athenian youth, for a larger measure of education and
other accomplishments; from an elevation in the standard of what was
required from every man who aspired to occupy a place in the eyes
of his fellow-citizens. Protagoras, Gorgias, and the rest, supplied
this demand with an ability and success unknown before their time;
hence they gained a distinction such as none of their predecessors
had attained, were prized all over Greece, travelled from city to
city with general admiration, and obtained considerable pay. While
such success, among men personally strangers to them, attests
unequivocally their talent and personal dignity, of course it also
laid them open to increased jealousy, as well from inferior teachers
as from the lovers of ignorance generally: such jealousy manifesting
itself, as I have before explained, by a greater readiness to stamp
them with the obnoxious title of sophists.</p>

<p>The hostility of Plato against these teachers,—for it is he, and
not Sokratês, who was peculiarly hostile to them, as may be seen
by the absence of any such marked antithesis in the Memorabilia of
Xenophon,—may be explained without at all supposing in them that
corruption which modern writers have been so ready not only to admit
but to magnify. It arose from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p.
357]</span> the radical difference between his point of view and
theirs. He was a great reformer and theorist; they undertook to
qualify young men for doing themselves credit, and rendering service
to others, in active Athenian life. Not only is there room for the
concurrent operation of both these veins of thought and action, in
every progressive society, but the intellectual outfit of the society
can never be complete without the one as well as the other. It was
the glory of Athens that both were there adequately represented,
at the period which we have now reached. Whoever peruses Plato’s
immortal work, “The Republic,” will see that he dissented from
society, both democratical and oligarchical, on some of the most
fundamental points of public and private morality; and throughout
most of his dialogues his quarrel is not less with the statesmen,
past as well as present, than with the paid teachers of Athens.
Besides this ardent desire for radical reform of the state, on
principles of his own, distinct from every recognized political party
or creed, Plato was also unrivalled as a speculative genius and
as a dialectician; both which capacities he put forth, to amplify
and illustrate the ethical theory and method first struck out by
Sokratês, as well as to establish comprehensive generalities of his
own.</p>

<p>Now his reforming, as well as his theorizing tendencies, brought
him into polemical controversy with all the leading agents by whom
the business of practical life at Athens was carried on. In so
far as Protagoras or Gorgias talked the language of theory, they
were doubtless much inferior to Plato, nor would their doctrines
be likely to hold against his acute dialectics. But it was neither
their duty, nor their engagement, to reform the state, or discover
and vindicate the best theory on ethics. They professed to qualify
young Athenians for an active and honorable life, private as well as
public, <i>in Athens</i>, or in any other given city; they taught them “to
think, speak, and act,” <i>in Athens</i>; they of course accepted, as the
basis of their teaching, that type of character which estimable men
exhibited and which the public approved, <i>in Athens</i>; not undertaking
to recast the type, but to arm it with new capacities and adorn it
with fresh accomplishments. Their direct business was with ethical
precept, not with ethical theory; all that was required of them, as
to the latter, was, that their theory should be sufficiently sound
to lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span> to such
practical precepts as were accounted virtuous by the most estimable
society <i>in Athens</i>. It ought never to be forgotten, that those
who taught for active life were bound, by the very conditions of
their profession, to adapt themselves to the place and the society
as it stood. With the theorist Plato, not only there was no such
obligation, but the grandeur and instructiveness of his speculations
were realized only by his departing from it, and placing himself on
a loftier pinnacle of vision; and he himself<a id="FNanchor_570"
href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> not only admits, but
even exaggerates, the unfitness and repugnance of men, taught in his
school, for practical life and duties.</p>

<p>To understand the essential difference between the practical
and the theoretical point of view, we need only look to Isokratês,
the pupil of Gorgias, and himself a sophist. Though not a man of
commanding abilities, Isokratês was one of the most estimable men
of Grecian antiquity. He taught for money; and taught young men
to “think, speak, and act,” all with a view to an honorable life
of active citizenship; not concealing his marked disparagement<a
id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
of speculative study and debate, such as the dialogues<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span> of Plato and the
dialectic exercises generally. He defends his profession much in the
same way as his master Gorgias, or Protagoras, would have defended
it, if we had before us vindications from their pens. Isokratês at
Athens, and Quintilian, a man equally estimable at Rome, are, in
their general type of character and professional duty, the fair
counterpart of those whom Plato arraigns as the sophists.</p>

<p>We know these latter chiefly from the evidence of Plato, their
pronounced enemy; yet even his evidence, when construed candidly and
taken as a whole, will not be found to justify the charges of corrupt
and immoral teaching, impostrous pretence of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> knowledge, etc., which the modern
historians pour forth in loud chorus against them. I know few
characters in history who have been so hardly dealt with as these
so-called sophists. They bear the penalty of their name, in its
modern sense; a misleading association, from which few modern writers
take pains to emancipate either themselves or their readers, though
the English or French word sophist is absolutely inapplicable to
Protagoras or Gorgias, who ought to be called rather “professors, or
public teachers.” It is really surprising to read the expositions
prefixed by learned men like Stallbaum and others, to the Platonic
dialogues entitled Protagoras, Gorgias, Euthydêmus, Theætêtus, etc.,
where Plato introduces Sokratês either in personal controversy with
one or other of these sophists, or as canvassing their opinions.
We continually read from the pen of the expositor, such remarks as
these: “Mark, how Plato puts down the shallow and worthless sophist;”
the obvious reflection, that it is Plato himself who plays both
games on the chess-board, being altogether overlooked. And again:
“This or that argument, placed in the mouth of Sokratês, is not to
be regarded as the real opinion of Plato: he only takes it up and
enforces it at this moment, in order to puzzle and humiliate an
ostentatious pretender;”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572"
class="fnanchor">[572]</a> a remark which con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span>verts Plato into an insincere disputant,
and a sophist in the modern sense, at the very moment when the
commentator is extolling his pure and lofty morality as an antidote
against the alleged corruption of Gorgias and Protagoras.</p>

<p>Plato has devoted a long and interesting dialogue to the inquiry,
What is a sophist?<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573"
class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and it is curious to observe that the
definition which he at last brings out suits Sokratês himself,
intellectually speaking, better than any one else whom we know.
Cicero defines the sophist to be one who pursues philosophy
for the sake of ostentation or of gain;<a id="FNanchor_574"
href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> which, if it is to be
held as a reproach, will certainly bear hard upon the great body of
modern teachers, who are determined to embrace their profession and
to discharge its important duties, like other professional men, by
the prospect either of deriving an income or of making a figure in
it, or both, whether they have any peculiar relish for the occupation
or not. But modern writers, in describing Protagoras or Gorgias,
while they adopt the sneering language of Plato against teaching
for pay, low purposes, tricks to get money from the rich, etc., use
terms which lead the reader to believe that there was something
in these sophists peculiarly greedy, exorbitant, and truckling;
something beyond the mere fact of asking and receiving remuneration.
Now not only there is no proof that any of them were thus dishonest
or exorbitant, but in the case of Protagoras, even his enemy Plato
furnishes a proof that he was not so. In the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> Platonic dialogue termed Protagoras,
that sophist is introduced as describing the manner in which he
proceeded respecting remuneration from his pupils. “I make no
stipulation beforehand: when a pupil parts from me, I ask from him
such a sum as I think the time and the circumstances warrant; and I
add, that if he deems the demand too great, he has only to make up
his own mind what is the amount of improvement which my company has
procured to him, and what sum he considers an equivalent for it. I
am content to accept the sum so named by himself, only requiring him
to go into a temple and make oath that it is his sincere belief.”<a
id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It
is not easy to imagine a more dignified way of dealing than this,
nor one which more thoroughly attests an honorable reliance on the
internal consciousness of the scholar, on the grateful sense of
improvement realized, which to every teacher constitutes a reward
hardly inferior to the payment that proceeds from it, and which, in
the opinion of Sokratês, formed the only legitimate reward. Such is
not the way in which the corruptors of mankind go to work.</p>

<p>That which stood most prominent in the teaching of Gorgias
and the other sophists, was, that they cultivated and improved
the powers of public speaking in their pupils; one of the most
essential accomplishments to every Athenian of consideration.
For this, too, they have been denounced by Ritter, Brandis, and
other learned writers on the history of philosophy, as corrupt
and immoral. “Teaching their pupils rhetoric (it has been said),
they only enabled them to second unjust designs, to make the worse
appear the better reason, and to delude their hearers, by trick and
artifice, into false persuasion and show of knowledge without<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span> reality. Rhetoric
(argues Plato, in the dialogue called Gorgias) is no art whatever,
but a mere unscientific knack, enslaved to the dominant prejudices,
and nothing better than an impostrous parody on the true political
art.” Now though Aristotle, following the Platonic vein, calls
this power of making the worse appear the better reason, “the
promise of Protagoras,”<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576"
class="fnanchor">[576]</a> the accusation ought never to be urged
as if it bore specially against the teachers of the Sokratic age.
It is an argument against rhetorical teaching generally; against
all the most distinguished teachers of pupils for active life,
throughout the ancient world, from Protagoras, Gorgias, Isokratês,
etc., down to Quintilian. Not only does the argument bear equally
against all, but it was actually urged against all. Isokratês<a
id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
and Quintilian both defend themselves against it: Aristotle replies
to it in the beginning of his treatise on rhetoric: nor was there
ever any man, indeed, against whom it was pressed with greater
bitterness of calumny than Sokratês, by Aristophanês, in his comedy
of the “Clouds,” as well as by other comic composers. Sokratês
complains of it in his defence before his judges;<a id="FNanchor_578"
href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> characterizing such
accusations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> in
their true point of view, as being “the stock reproaches against
all who pursue philosophy.” They are indeed only one of the
manifestations, ever varying in form though the same in spirit, of
the antipathy of ignorance against dissenting innovation or superior
mental accomplishments; which antipathy, intellectual men themselves,
when it happens to make on their side in a controversy, are but too
ready to invoke. Considering that we have here the materials of
defence, as well as of attack, supplied by Sokratês and Plato, it
might have been expected that modern writers would have refrained
from employing such an argument to discredit Gorgias or Protagoras;
the rather, as they have before their eyes, in all the countries of
modern Europe, the profession of lawyers and advocates, who lend
their powerful eloquence without distinction to the cause of justice
or injustice, and who, far from being regarded as the corrupters of
society, are usually looked upon, for that very reason among others,
as indispensable auxiliaries to a just administration of law.</p>

<p>Though writing was less the business of these sophists
than personal teaching, several of them published treatises.
Thrasymachus and Theodôrus both set forth written precepts on
the art of rhetoric;<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a> precepts which have not descended to us,
but which appear to have been narrow and special, bearing directly
upon practice, and relating chiefly to the proper component parts
of an oration. To Aristotle, who had attained that large and
comprehensive view of the theory of rhetoric which still remains
to instruct us in his splendid treatise, the views of Thrasymachus
appeared unimportant, serving to him only as hints and materials.
But their effect must have been very different when they first
appeared, and when young men were first enabled to analyze the parts
of an harangue, to understand the dependence of one upon the other,
and call them by their appropriate names; all illustrated, let us
recollect, by oral exposition on the part of the master, which was
the most impressive portion of the whole.</p>

<p>Prodikus, again, published one or more treatises intended
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span> elucidate the
ambiguities of words, and to point out the different significations
of terms apparently, but not really, equivalent. For this Plato often
ridicules him, and the modern historians of philosophy generally
think it right to adopt the same tone. Whether the execution of
the work was at all adequate to its purpose, we have no means of
judging; but assuredly the purpose was one preëminently calculated
to aid Grecian thinkers and dialecticians; for no man can study
their philosophy without seeing how lamentably they were hampered by
enslavement to the popular phraseology, and by inferences founded on
mere verbal analogy. At a time when neither dictionary nor grammar
existed, a teacher who took care, even punctilious care, in fixing
the meaning of important words of his discourse, must be considered
as guiding the minds of his hearers in a salutary direction;
salutary, we may add, even to Plato himself, whose speculations would
most certainly have been improved by occasional hints from such a
monitor.</p>

<p>Protagoras, too, is said to have been the first who discriminated
and gave names to the various modes and forms of address, an
analysis well calculated to assist his lessons on right speaking:<a
id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
he appears also to have been the first who distinguished the three
genders of nouns. We hear further of a treatise which he wrote
on wrestling, or most probably on gymnastics generally, as well
as a collection of controversial dialogues.<a id="FNanchor_581"
href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> But his most
celebrated treatise was one entitled “Truth,” seemingly on philosophy
generally. Of this treatise, we do not even know the general scope
or purport. In one of his treatises, he confessed his inability to
satisfy himself about the existence of the gods, in these words:<a
id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
“Respecting the gods, I neither know whether they exist, nor<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> what are their
attributes: the uncertainty of the subject, the shortness of
human life, and many other causes, debar me from this knowledge.”
That the believing public of Athens were seriously indignant at
this passage, and that it caused the author to be threatened with
prosecution, and forced to quit Athens, we can perfectly understand;
though there seems no sufficient proof of the tale that he was
drowned in his outward voyage. But that modern historians of
philosophy, who consider the pagan gods to be fictions, and the
religion to be repugnant to any reasonable mind, should concur in
denouncing Protagoras on this ground as a corrupt man, is to me less
intelligible. Xenophanês,<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583"
class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and probably many other philosophers, had
said the same thing before him. Nor is it easy to see what a superior
man was to do, who could not adjust his standard of belief to such
fictions; or what he could say, if he said anything, less than the
words cited above from Protagoras; which appear, as far as we can
appreciate them, standing without the context, to be a brief mention,
in modest and circumspect phrases, of the reason why he said nothing
about the gods, in a treatise where the reader would expect to find
much upon the subject.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584"
class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Certain it is that in the Platonic
dialogue, called “Protagoras,” that sophist is introduced speaking
about the gods exactly in the manner that any orthodox pagan might
naturally adopt.</p>

<p>The other fragment preserved of Protagoras, relates to his view
of the cognitive process, and of truth generally. He taught, that
“Man is the measure of all things; both of that which exists,
and of that which does not exist:” a doctrine canvassed and
controverted by Plato, who represents that Protagoras affirmed
knowledge to consist in sensation, and considered the sensations
of each individual man to be, to him, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span> canon and measure of truth. We know
scarce anything of the elucidations or limitations with which
Protagoras may have accompanied his general position: and if even
Plato, who had good means of knowing them, felt it ungenerous to
insult an orphan doctrine whose father was recently dead, and could
no longer defend it,<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585"
class="fnanchor">[585]</a> much more ought modern authors, who
speak with mere scraps of evidence before them, to be cautious how
they heap upon the same doctrine insults much beyond those which
Plato recognizes. In so far as we can pretend to understand the
theory, it was certainly not more incorrect than several others
then afloat, from the Eleatic school and other philosophers; while
it had the merit of bringing into forcible relief, though in an
erroneous manner, the essentially relative nature of cognition,<a
id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
relative, not indeed to the sensitive faculty alone,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> but to that reinforced
and guided by the other faculties of man, memorial and ratiocinative.
And had it been even more incorrect than it really is, there would
be no warrant for those imputations which modern authors build upon
it, against the morality of Protagoras. No such imputations are
countenanced in the discussion which Plato devotes to the doctrine:
indeed, if the vindication which he sets forth against himself on
behalf of Protagoras be really ascribable to that sophist, it would
give an exaggerated importance to the distinction between Good and
Evil, into which the distinction between Truth and Falsehood is
considered by the Platonic Protagoras as resolvable. The subsequent
theories of Plato and Aristotle respecting cognition, were much
more systematic and elaborate, the work of men greatly superior in
speculative genius to Protagoras: but they would not have been what
they were, had not Protagoras, as well as others gone before them,
with suggestions more partial and imperfect.</p>

<p>From Gorgias there remains one short essay, preserved in
one of the Aristotelian, or Pseudo-Aristotelian treatises,<a
id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>
on a metaphysical thesis. He professes to demonstrate that nothing
exists: that if anything exist, it is unknowable; and granting it
even to exist and to be knowable by any one man, he could never
communicate it to others. The modern historians of philosophy here
prefer the easier task of denouncing the skepticism of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> sophist, instead of
performing the duty incumbent on them of explaining his thesis in
immediate sequence with the speculations which preceded it. In our
sense of the words, it is a monstrous paradox: but construing them in
their legitimate filiation from the Eleatic philosophers immediately
before him, it is a plausible, not to say conclusive, deduction from
principles which they would have acknowledged.<a id="FNanchor_588"
href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> The word existence,
as they understood it, did not mean phenomenal, but ultra-phenomenal
existence. They looked upon the phenomena of sense as always coming
and going, as something essentially transitory, fluctuating,
incapable of being surely known, and furnishing at best grounds only
for conjecture. They searched by cogitation for what they presumed
to be the really existent something or substance—the noumenon,
to use a Kantian phrase—lying behind or under the phenomena,
which noumenon they recognized as the only appropriate subject of
knowledge. They discussed much, as I have before remarked, whether
it was one or many; noumenon in the singular, or noumena in the
plural. Now the thesis of Gorgias related to this ultra-phenomenal
existence, and bore closely upon the arguments of Zeno and Melissus,
the Eleatic reasoners of his elder contemporaries. He denied that
any such ultra-phenomenal something, or noumenon, existed, or could
be known, or could be described. Of this tripartite thesis, the
first negation was neither more untenable, nor less untenable,
than that of those philosophers who before him had argued for the
affirmative: on the two last points, his conclusions were neither
paradoxical nor improperly skeptical, but perfectly just, and
have been ratified by the gradual abandonment, either avowed or
implied, of such ultra-phenomenal researches among the major part of
philosophers. It may fairly be presumed that these doctrines were
urged by Gorgias for the purpose of diverting his disciples from
studies which he considered as unpromising and fruitless: just as we
shall find his pupil Isokratês afterwards enforcing the same view,
discouraging speculations of this nature, and recommending rhetorical
exercise as preparation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p.
370]</span> for the duties of an active citizen.<a id="FNanchor_589"
href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Nor must we forget
that Sokratês himself discouraged physical speculations even more
decidedly than either of them.</p>

<p>If the censures cast upon the alleged skepticism of Gorgias and
Protagoras are partly without sufficient warrant, partly without any
warrant at all, much more may the same remark be made respecting
the graver reproaches heaped upon their teaching on the score of
immorality or corruption. It has been common with recent German
historians of philosophy to translate from Plato and dress up a
fiend called “Die Sophistik,” (Sophistic,) whom they assert to
have poisoned and demoralized, by corrupt teaching, the Athenian
moral character, so that it became degenerate at the end of the
Peloponnesian war, compared with what it had been in the time of
Miltiadês and Aristeidês.</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, if the abstraction “Die Sophistik” is to
have any definite meaning, we ought to have proof that the persons
styled sophists had some doctrines, principles, or method, both
common to them all and distinguishing them from others. But such
a supposition is untrue: there were no such common doctrines, or
principles, or method, belonging to them; even the name by which
they are known did not belong to them, any more than to Sokratês
and others; they had nothing in common except their profession, as
paid teachers, qualifying young men “to think, speak, and act,”
these are the words of Isokratês, and better words it would not
be easy to find, with credit to themselves as citizens. Moreover,
such community of profession did not at that time imply near so
much analogy of character as it does now, when the path of teaching
has been beaten into a broad and visible high road, with measured
distances and stated intervals: Protagoras and Gorgias found
predecessors, indeed, but no binding precedents to copy; so that
each struck out more or less a road of his own. And accordingly, we
find Plato, in his dialogue called “Protagoras,” wherein Protagoras,
Prodikus, and Hippias, are all introduced, imparting a distinct
type of character and distinct method to each, not without a strong
admixture of reciprocal jealousy between them; while Thrasymachus, in
the Republic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> and
Euthydêmus, in the dialogue so called, are again painted each with
colors of his own, different from all the three above named. We have
not the least reason for presuming that Gorgias agreed in the opinion
of Protagoras: “Man is the measure of all things;” and we may infer,
even from Plato himself, that Protagoras would have opposed the views
expressed by Thrasymachus in the first book of the Republic. It is
impossible therefore to predicate anything concerning doctrines,
methods, or tendencies, common and peculiar to all the sophists.
There were none such; nor has the abstract word, “Die Sophistik,”
any real meaning, except such qualities, whatever they may be,
as are inseparable from the profession or occupation of public
teaching. And if, at present, every candid critic would be ashamed
to cast wholesale aspersions on the entire body of professional
teachers, much more is such censure unbecoming in reference to the
ancient sophists, who were distinguished from each other by stronger
individual peculiarities.</p>

<p>If, then, it were true that in the interval between 480 <small>B.C.</small> and the end of the Peloponnesian war, a
great moral deterioration had taken place in Athens and in Greece
generally, we should have to search for some other cause than this
imaginary abstraction called sophistic. But—and this is the second
point—the matter of fact here alleged is as untrue, as the cause
alleged is unreal. Athens, at the close of the Peloponnesian war,
was not more corrupt than Athens in the days of Miltiadês and
Aristeidês. If we revert to that earlier period, we shall find that
scarcely any acts of the Athenian people have drawn upon them sharper
censure—in my judgment, unmerited—than their treatment of these very
two statesmen; the condemnation of Miltiadês, and the ostracism of
Aristeidês. In writing my history of that time, far from finding
previous historians disposed to give the Athenians credit for public
virtue, I have been compelled to contend against a body of adverse
criticism, imputing to them gross ingratitude and injustice. Thus the
contemporaries of Miltiadês and Aristeidês, when described as matter
of present history, are presented in anything but flattering colors;
except their valor at Marathon and Salamis, which finds one unanimous
voice of encomium. But when these same men have become numbered among
the mingled recollections and fancies belonging to the past,—when
a future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span>
generation comes to be present, with its appropriate stock of
complaint and denunciation,—then it is that men find pleasure in
dressing up the virtues of the past, as a count in the indictment
against their own contemporaries. Aristophanês,<a id="FNanchor_590"
href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> writing during the
Peloponnesian war, denounced the Demos of his day as degenerated
from the virtue of that Demos which had surrounded Miltiadês and
Aristeidês: while Isokratês,<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a> writing as an old man, between 350-340
<small>B.C.</small>, complains in like manner of his own
time, boasting how much better the state of Athens had been in his
youth: which period of his youth fell exactly during the life of
Aristophanês, in the last half of the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>Such illusions ought to impose on no one without a careful
comparison of facts; and most assuredly that comparison will not
bear out the allegation of increased corruption and degeneracy,
between the age of Miltiadês and the end of the Peloponnesian war.
Throughout the whole of Athenian history, there are no acts which
attest so large a measure of virtue and judgment pervading the whole
people, as the proceedings after the Four Hundred and after the
Thirty. Nor do I believe that the contemporaries of Miltiadês would
have been capable of such heroism; for that appellation is by no
means too large for the case. I doubt whether they would have been
competent to the steady self-denial of retaining a large sum in
reserve during the time of peace, both prior to the Peloponnesian
war and after the Peace of Nikias; or of keeping back the reserve
fund of one thousand talents, while they were forced to pay taxes for
the support of the war; or of acting upon the prudent, yet painfully
trying, policy recommended by Periklês, so as to sustain an annual
invasion without either going out to fight or purchasing peace
by ignominious concessions. If bad acts such as Athens committed
during the later years of the war, for example, the massacre of the
Melian population, were not done equally by the contemporaries of
Miltiadês, this did not arise from any superior humanity or principle
on their part, but from the fact that they were not exposed to the
like temptation, brought upon them by the possession of imperial
power. The condemnation of the six generals<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span> after the battle of Arginusæ, if we
suppose the same conduct on their part to have occurred in 490 <small>B.C.</small>, would have been decreed more rapidly
and more unceremoniously than it was actually decreed in 406 <small>B.C.</small> For at that earlier date there existed
no psephism of Kannônus, surrounded by prescriptive respect; no
graphê paranomôn; no such habits of established deference to a
dikastery solemnly sworn, with full notice to defendants and full
time of defence measured by the clock; none of those securities
which a long course of democracy had gradually worked into the
public morality of every Athenian, and which, as we saw in a
former chapter, interposed a serious barrier to the impulse of the
moment, though ultimately overthrown by its fierceness. A far less
violent impulse would have sufficed for the same mischief in 490
<small>B.C.</small>, when no such barriers existed.
Lastly, if we want a measure of the appreciating sentiment of the
Athenian public, towards a strict and decorous morality in the
narrow sense, in the middle of the Peloponnesian war, we have only
to consider the manner in which they dealt with Nikias. I have
shown, in describing the Sicilian expedition, that the gravest
error which the Athenians ever committed, that which shipwrecked
both their armament at Syracuse and their power at home, arose from
their unmeasured esteem for the respectable and pious Nikias, which
blinded them to the grossest defects of generalship and public
conduct. Disastrous as such misjudgment was, it counts at least as
a proof that the moral corruption alleged to have been operated in
their characters, is a mere fiction. Nor let it be supposed that
the nerve and resolution which once animated the combatants of
Marathon and Salamis, had disappeared in the latter years of the
Peloponnesian war. On the contrary, the energetic and protracted
struggle of Athens, after the irreparable calamity at Syracuse,
forms a worthy parallel to her resistance in the time of Xerxes, and
maintained unabated that distinctive attribute which Periklês had
set forth as the main foundation of her glory, that of never giving
way before misfortune.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592"
class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Without any disparagement to the armament
at Salamis, we may remark that the patriotism of the fleet at Samos,
which rescued Athens from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p.
374]</span> Four Hundred, was equally devoted and more intelligent;
and that the burst of effort, which sent a subsequent fleet to
victory at Arginusæ, was to the full as strenuous.</p>

<p>If, then, we survey the eighty-seven years of Athenian history,
between the battle of Marathon and the renovation of the democracy
after the Thirty, we shall see no ground for the assertion, so
often made, of increased and increasing moral and political
corruption. It is my belief that the people had become both morally
and politically better, and that their democracy had worked to
their improvement. The remark made by Thucydidês, on the occasion
of the Korkyræan bloodshed,—on the violent and reckless political
antipathies, arising out of the confluence of external warfare
with internal party-feud,<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593"
class="fnanchor">[593]</a>—wherever else it may find its application,
has no bearing upon Athens: the proceedings after the Four Hundred
and after the Thirty prove the contrary. And while Athens may thus be
vindicated on the moral side, it is indisputable that her population
had acquired a far larger range of ideas and capacities than they
possessed at the time of the battle of Marathon. This, indeed, is the
very matter of fact deplored by Aristophanês, and admitted by those
writers, who, while denouncing the sophists, connect such enlarged
range of ideas with the dissemination of the pretended sophistical
poison. In my judgment, not only the charge against the sophists as
poisoners, but even the existence of such poison in the Athenian
system, deserves nothing less than an emphatic denial.</p>

<p>Let us examine again the names of these professional teachers,
beginning with Prodikus, one of the most renowned. Who is there
that has not read the well-known fable called “The Choice of
Hercules,” which is to be found in every book professing to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span> collect impressive
illustrations of elementary morality? Who does not know that
its express purpose is, to kindle the imaginations of youth in
favor of a life of labor for noble objects, and against a life of
indulgence? It was the favorite theme on which Prodikus lectured,
and on which he obtained the largest audience.<a id="FNanchor_594"
href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> If it be of striking
simplicity and effect even to a modern reader, how much more
powerfully must it have worked upon the audience for whose belief
it was specially adapted, when set off by the oral expansions of
its author! Xenophon wondered that the Athenian dikasts dealt
with Sokratês as a corruptor of youth,—Isokratês wondered that
a portion of the public made the like mistake about him,—and I
confess my wonder to be not less, that not only Aristophanês,<a
id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> but
even the modern writers on Grecian philosophy, should rank Prodikus
in the same unenviable catalogue. This is the only composition<a
id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
remaining from him; indeed, the only composition remaining from any
one of the sophists, excepting the thesis of Gorgias, above noticed.
It served, not merely as a vindication of Prodikus against such
reproach, but also as a warning against implicit confidence in the
sarcastic remarks of Plato,—which include Prodikus as well as the
other sophists,—and in the doctrines which he puts into the mouth
of the sophists generally, in order that Sokratês may confute them.
The commonest candor would teach us, that if a polemical writer of
dialogue chooses to put indefensible doctrine<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span> into the mouth of the opponent, we
ought to be cautious of condemning the latter upon such very dubious
proof.</p>

<p>Welcker and other modern authors treat Prodikus as “the most
innocent” of the sophists, and except him from the sentence which
they pass upon the class generally. Let us see, therefore, what Plato
himself says about the rest of them, and first about Protagoras. If
it were not the established practice with readers of Plato to condemn
Protagoras beforehand, and to put upon every passage relating to
him not only a sense as bad as it will bear, but much worse than
it will fairly bear, they would probably carry away very different
inferences from the Platonic dialogue called by that sophist’s
name, and in which he is made to bear a chief part. That dialogue
is itself enough to prove that Plato did not conceive Protagoras
either as a corrupt, or unworthy, or incompetent teacher. The
course of the dialogue exhibits him as not master of the theory of
ethics, and unable to solve various difficulties with which that
theory is expected to grapple; moreover, as no match for Sokratês
in dialectics, which Plato considered as the only efficient method
of philosophical investigation. In so far, therefore, as imperfect
acquaintance with the science or theory upon which rules of art, or
the precepts bearing on practice, repose, disqualifies a teacher
from giving instruction in such art or practice, to that extent
Protagoras is exposed as wanting. And if an expert dialectician, like
Plato, had passed Isokratês or Quintilian, or the large majority
of teachers past or present, through a similar cross-examination
as to the theory of their teaching, an ignorance not less manifest
than that of Protagoras would be brought out. The antithesis which
Plato sets forth, in so many of his dialogues, between precept or
practice, accompanied by full knowledge of the scientific principles
from which it must be deduced, if its rectitude be disputed,—and
unscientific practice, without any such power of deduction or
defence, is one of the most valuable portions of his speculations:
he exhausts his genius to render it conspicuous in a thousand
indirect ways, and to shame his readers, if possible, into the
loftier and more rational walk of thought. But it is one thing to
say of a man, that he does not know the theory of what he teaches,
or of the way in which he teaches; it is another thing to say,
that he actually teaches that which scientific theory would<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> not prescribe as
the best; it is a third thing, graver than both, to say that his
teaching is not only below the exigences of science, but even corrupt
and demoralizing. Now of these three points, it is the first only
which Plato in his dialogue makes out against Protagoras: even the
second, he neither affirms nor insinuates; and as to the third,
not only he never glances at it, even indirectly, but the whole
tendency of the discourse suggests a directly contrary conclusion.
As if sensible that when an eminent opponent was to be depicted as
puzzled and irritated by superior dialectics, it was but common
fairness to set forth his distinctive merits also, Plato gives a
fable, and expository harangue, from the mouth of Protagoras,<a
id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
upon the question whether virtue is teachable. This harangue is,
in my judgment, very striking and instructive; and so it would
have been probably accounted, if commentators had not read it with
a preëstablished persuasion that whatever came from the lips of a
sophist must be either ridiculous or immoral.<a id="FNanchor_598"
href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> It is the only part
of Plato’s works wherein any account is rendered of the growth of
that floating, uncertified, self-propagating body of opinion, upon
which the cross-examining analysis of Sokratês is brought to bear, as
will be seen in the following chapter.</p>

<p>Protagoras professes to teach his pupils “good counsel” in
their domestic and family relations, as well as how to speak and
act in the most effective manner for the weal of the city. Since
this comes from Protagoras, the commentators of Plato pronounce
it to be miserable morality; but it coincides, almost to the
letter, with that which Isokratês describes himself as teaching,
a generation afterwards, and substantially even with that which
Xenophon represents Sokratês as teaching; nor is it easy to set
forth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span> in a
few words, a larger scheme of practical duty.<a id="FNanchor_599"
href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> And if the measure
of practical duty, which Protagoras devoted himself to teach, was
thus serious and extensive, even the fraction of theory<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> assigned to him in his
harangue, includes some points better than that of Plato himself. For
Plato seems to have conceived the ethical end, to each individual,
as comprising nothing more than his own permanent happiness and
moral health; and in this very dialogue, he introduces Sokratês
as maintaining virtue to consist only in a right calculation of a
man’s own personal happiness and misery. But here we find Protagoras
speaking in a way which implies a larger, and, in my opinion, a
juster, appreciation of the ethical end, as including not only
reference to a man’s own happiness, but also obligations towards
the happiness of others. Without at all agreeing in the harsh terms
of censure which various critics pronounce upon that theory which
Sokratês is made to set forth in the Platonic Protagoras, I consider
his conception of the ethical end essentially narrow and imperfect,
not capable of being made to serve as basis for deduction of the best
ethical precepts. Yet such is the prejudice with which the history
of the sophists has been written, that the commentators on Plato
accuse the sophists of having originated what they ignorantly term,
“the base theory of utility,” here propounded by Sokratês himself;
complimenting the latter on having set forth those larger views which
in this dialogue belong only to Protagoras.<a id="FNanchor_600"
href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span></p>

<p>So far as concerns Protagoras, therefore, the evidence of Plato
himself may be produced to show that he was not a corrupt teacher,
but a worthy companion of Prodikus; worthy also of that which we
know him to have enjoyed, the society and conversation of Periklês.
Let us now examine what Plato says about a third sophist, Hippias
of Elis; who figures both in the dialogue called “Protagoras,”
and in two distinct dialogues known by the titles of “Hippias
Major and Minor.” Hippias is represented as distinguished for the
wide range of his accomplishments, of which in these dialogues he
ostentatiously boasts. He could teach astronomy, geometry, and
arithmetic, which subjects Protagoras censured him for enforcing
too much upon his pupils; so little did these sophists agree in
any one scheme of doctrine or education. Besides this, he was a
poet, a musician, an expositor of the poets, and a lecturer with
a large stock of composed matter,—on sub<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span>jects moral, political, and even
legendary,—treasured up in a very retentive memory. He was a citizen
much employed as envoy by his fellow-citizens: to crown all, his
manual dexterity was such that he professed to have made with his
own hands all the attire and ornaments which he wore on his person.
If, as is sufficiently probable, he was a vain and ostentatious
man,—defects not excluding an useful and honorable career,—we must
at the same time give him credit for a variety of acquisitions such
as to explain a certain measure of vanity.<a id="FNanchor_601"
href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The style in which
Plato handles Hippias is very different from that in which he treats
Protagoras. It is full of sneer and contemptuous banter, insomuch
that even Stallbaum,<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602"
class="fnanchor">[602]</a> after having repeated a great many times
that this was a vile sophist, who deserved no better treatment,
is forced to admit that the petulance is carried rather too far,
and to suggest that the dialogue must have been a juvenile work of
Plato. Be this as it may, amidst so much unfriendly handling, not
only we find no imputation against Hippias, of having preached a
low or corrupt morality, but Plato inserts that which furnishes
good, though indirect, proof of the contrary. For Hippias is made
to say that he had already delivered, and was about to deliver
again, a lecture composed by himself with great care, wherein he
enlarged upon the aims and pursuits which a young man ought to
follow. The scheme of his discourse was, that after the capture of
Troy, the youthful Neoptolemus was introduced as asking the advice
of Nestor about his own future conduct; in reply to which, Nestor
sets forth to him what was the plan of life incumbent on a young man
of honorable aspirations, and unfolds to him the full details of
regulated and virtuous conduct by which it ought to be filled up.<a
id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
The selection of two such names, among the most venerated in all
Grecian legend, as monitor and pupil, is a stamp clearly attesting
the vein of sentiment which animated the composition. Morality
preached by Nestor for the edification of Neoptolemus, might possibly
be too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> high for
Athenian practice; but most certainly it would not err on the side of
corruption, selfishness, or over-indulgence. We may fairly presume
that this discourse composed by Hippias would not be unworthy, in
spirit and purpose, to be placed by the side of “The Choice of
Hercules,” nor its author by that of Prodikus as a moral teacher.</p>

<p>The dialogue entitled “Gorgias,” in Plato, is carried on by
Sokratês with three different persons one after the other,—Gorgias,
Pôlus, and Kalliklês. Gorgias of Leontini in Sicily, as a rhetorical
teacher, acquired greater celebrity than any man of his time,
during the Peloponnesian war: his abundant powers of illustration,
his florid ornaments, his artificial structure of sentences
distributed into exact antithetical fractions, all spread a new
fashion in the art of speaking, which for the time was very popular,
but afterwards became discredited. If the line could be clearly
drawn between rhetors and sophists, Gorgias ought rather to be
ranked with the former.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604"
class="fnanchor">[604]</a> In the conversation with Gorgias, Sokratês
exposes the fallacy and imposture of rhetoric and rhetorical
teaching, as cheating an ignorant audience into persuasion without
knowledge, and as framed to satisfy the passing caprice, without
any regard to the permanent welfare and improvement of the people.
Whatever real inculpation may be conveyed in these arguments against
a rhetorical teacher, Gorgias must bear in common with Isokratês
and Quintilian, and under the shield of Aristotle. But save and
except rhetorical teaching, no dissemination of corrupt morality
is ascribed to him by Plato; who, indeed, treats him with a degree
of respect which surprises the commentators.<a id="FNanchor_605"
href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>The tone of the dialogue changes materially when it passes to
Pôlus and Kalliklês, the former of whom is described as a writer
on rhetoric, and probably a teacher also.<a id="FNanchor_606"
href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> There is much
insolence in Pôlus, and no small asperity in Sokratês. Yet the
former maintains no arguments which justify the charge of immorality
against himself or his fellow-teachers. He defends the tastes<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> and sentiments common
to every man in Greece, and shared even by the most estimable
Athenians, Periklês, Nikias, and Aristokratês;<a id="FNanchor_607"
href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> while Sokratês prides
himself on standing absolutely alone, and having no support except
from his irresistible dialectics, whereby he is sure of extorting
reluctant admission from his adversary. How far Sokratês may be
right, I do not now inquire: it is sufficient that Pôlus, standing
as he does amidst company at once so numerous and so irreproachable,
cannot be fairly denounced as a poisoner of the youthful mind.</p>

<p id="Kalli">Pôlus presently hands over the dialogue to Kalliklês,
who is here represented, doubtless, as laying down doctrines openly
and avowedly anti-social. He distinguishes between the law of
nature and the law—both written and unwritten, for the Greek word
substantially includes both—of society. According to the law of
nature, Kalliklês says, the strong man—the better or more capable
man—puts forth his strength to the full for his own advantage,
without limit or restraint; overcomes the resistance which weaker
men are able to offer; and seizes for himself as much as he pleases
of the matter of enjoyment. He has no occasion to restrain any of
his appetites or desires; the more numerous and pressing they are,
so much the better for him, since his power affords him the means of
satiating them all. The many, who have the misfortune to be weak,
must be content with that which he leaves them, and submit to it as
best they can. This, Kalliklês says, is what actually happens in a
state of nature; this is what is accounted just, as is evident by
the practice of independent communities, not included in one common
political society, towards each other; this is <i>justice</i>, by nature,
or according to the law of nature. But when men come into society,
all this is reversed. The majority of individuals know very well
that they are weak, and that their only chance of security or<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> comfort consists in
establishing laws to restrain this strong man, reinforced by a moral
sanction of praise and blame devoted to the same general end. They
catch him, like a young lion, whilst his mind is yet tender, and
fascinate him by talk and training into a disposition conformable
to that measure and equality which the law enjoins. Here, then,
is justice according to the law of society; a factitious system,
built up by the many for their own protection and happiness, to the
subversion of the law of nature, which arms the strong man with a
right to encroachment and license. Let a fair opportunity occur,
and the favorite of Nature will be seen to kick off his harness,
tread down the laws, break through the magic circle of opinion
around him, and stand forth again as lord and master of the many;
regaining that glorious position which nature has assigned to him
as his right. Justice by nature, and justice by law and society,
are thus, according to Kalliklês, not only distinct, but mutually
contradictory. He accuses Sokratês of having jumbled the two
together in his argument.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608"
class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>It has been contended by many authors that this anti-social
reasoning—true enough, in so far as it states simple<a
id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
matter of fact and probability; immoral, in so far as it erects
the power of the strong man into a right; and inviting many
comments, if I could find a convenient place for them—represents
the morality commonly and publicly taught by the persons called
sophists at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610"
class="fnanchor">[610]</a> I deny this assertion emphatically. Even
if I had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span>
other evidence to sustain my denial, except what has been already
extracted, from the unfriendly writings of Plato himself, respecting
Protagoras and Hippias,—with what we know from Xenophon about
Prodikus,—I should consider my case made out as vindicating the
sophists generally from such an accusation. If refutation to the
doctrine of Kalliklês were needed, it would be obtained quite as
efficaciously from Prodikus and Protagoras as from Sokratês and
Plato.</p>

<p>But this is not the strongest part of the vindication.</p>

<p>First, Kalliklês himself is not a sophist, nor represented by
Plato as such. He is a young Athenian citizen, of rank and station,
belonging to the deme Acharnæ; he is intimate with other young
men of condition in the city, has recently entered into active
political life, and bends his whole soul towards it; he disparages
philosophy, and speaks with utter contempt about the sophists.<a
id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> If,
then, it were even just, which I do not admit, to infer from opinions
put into the mouth of one sophist, that the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span> same were held by another or by all of
them, it would not be the less unjust to draw the like inference from
opinions professed by one who is not a sophist, and who despises the
whole profession.</p>

<p>Secondly, if any man will read attentively the course of the
dialogue, he will see that the doctrine of Kalliklês is such as no
one dared publicly to propound. So it is conceived both by Kalliklês
himself, and by Sokratês. The former first takes up the conversation,
by saying that his predecessor Pôlus had become entangled in a
contradiction, because he had not courage enough openly to announce
an unpopular and odious doctrine; but he, Kalliklês, was less
shamefaced, and would speak out boldly that doctrine which others
kept to themselves for fear of shocking the hearers. “Certainly (says
Sokratês to him) your audacity is abundantly shown by the doctrine
which you have just laid down; you set forth plainly that which
other people think, but do not choose to utter.”<a id="FNanchor_612"
href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Now, opinions of
which Pôlus, an insolent young man, was afraid to proclaim himself
the champion, must have been revolting indeed to the sentiments
of hearers. How then can any reasonable man believe, that such
opinions were not only openly propounded, but seriously inculcated as
truth upon audiences of youthful hearers, by the sophists? We know
that the teaching of the latter was public in the highest degree;
publicity was pleasing as well as profitable to them; among the many
disparaging epithets heaped upon them, ostentation and vanity are two
of the most conspicuous. Whatever they taught, they taught publicly;
and I contend, with full conviction, that, had they even agreed with
Kalliklês in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span>
opinion, they could neither have been sufficiently audacious, nor
sufficiently their own enemies, to make it a part of their public
teaching; but would have acted like Pôlus, and kept the doctrine to
themselves.</p>

<p>Thirdly, this latter conclusion will be rendered doubly certain,
when we consider of what city we are now speaking. Of all places in
the world, the democratical Athens is the last in which the doctrine
advanced by Kalliklês could possibly have been professed by a public
teacher; or even by Kalliklês himself, in any public meeting. It is
unnecessary to remind the reader how profoundly democratical was the
sentiment and morality of the Athenians,—how much they loved their
laws, their constitution, and their political equality,—how jealous
their apprehension was of any nascent or threatening despotism. All
this is not simply admitted, but even exaggerated, by Mr. Mitford,
Wachsmuth, and other anti-democratical writers, who often draw from
it materials for their abundant censures. Now the very point which
Sokratês, in this dialogue, called “Gorgias,” seeks to establish
against Kalliklês, against the rhetors, and against the sophists,
is, that they courted, flattered, and truckled to the sentiment of
the Athenian people, with degrading subservience; that they looked
to the immediate gratification simply, and not to permanent moral
improvement of the people; that they had not courage to address to
them any unpalatable truths, however salutary, but would shift and
modify opinions in every way, so as to escape giving offence;<a
id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
that no man who put himself prominently forward at Athens had any
chance of success, unless he became moulded and assimilated, from
the core, to the people and their type of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> sentiment<a id="FNanchor_614"
href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>. Granting such
charges to be true, how is it conceivable that any sophist, or any
rhetor, could venture to enforce upon an Athenian public audience
the doctrine laid down by Kalliklês? To tell such an audience:
“Your laws and institutions are all violations of the law of
nature, contrived to disappoint the Alkibiadês or Napoleon among
you of his natural right to become your master, and to deal with
you petty men as his slaves. All your unnatural precautions, and
conventional talk, in favor of legality and equal dealing, will turn
out to be nothing better than pitiful impotence<a id="FNanchor_615"
href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>, as soon as <i>he</i>
finds a good opportunity of standing forward in his full might and
energy, so as to put you into your proper places, and show you
what privileges Nature intends for her favorites!” Conceive such a
doctrine propounded by a lecturer to assembled Athenians! A doctrine
just as revolting to Nikias as to Kleon, and which even Alkibiadês
would be forced to affect to disapprove; since it is not simply
anti-popular, not simply despotic, but the drunken extravagance of
despotism. The Great man, as depicted by Kalliklês, stands in the
same relation to ordinary mortals, as Jonathan Wild the Great, in the
admirable parody of Fielding.</p>

<p>That sophists, whom Plato accuses of slavish flattery to the
democratical ear, should gratuitously insult it by the proposition of
such tenets, is an assertion not merely untrue, but utterly absurd.
Even as to Sokratês, we know from Xenophon how much the Athenians
were offended with him, and how much it was urged by the accusers
on his trial, that in his conversations he was wont to cite with
peculiar relish the description, in the second book of the Iliad,
of Odysseus following the Grecian crowd, when running away from
the agora to get on shipboard, and prevailing upon them to come
back, by gentle words ad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p.
389]</span>dressed to the chiefs, but by blows of his stick,
accompanied with contemptuous reprimand, to the common people. The
indirect evidence thus afforded, that Sokratês countenanced unequal
dealing and ill usage towards the many, told much against him in
the minds of the dikasts. What would they have felt then towards a
sophist who publicly professed the political morality of Kalliklês?
The truth is, not only was it impossible that any such morality, or
anything of the same type even much diluted, could find its way into
the educational lectures of professors at Athens, but the fear would
be in the opposite direction. If the sophist erred in either way,
it would be in that which Sokratês imputes, by making his lectures
over-democratical. Nay, if we suppose any opportunity to have arisen
of discussing the doctrine of Kalliklês, he would hardly omit to
flatter the ears of the surrounding democrats by enhancing the
beneficent results of legality and equal dealing, and by denouncing
this “natural despot,” or undisclosed Napoleon, as one who must
either take his place under such restraints, or find a place in some
other city.</p>

<p>I have thus shown, even from Plato himself, that the doctrine
ascribed to Kalliklês neither did enter, nor could have entered, into
the lectures of a sophist or professed teacher. The same conclusion
may be maintained respecting the doctrine of Thrasymachus in the
first book of the “Republic.” Thrasymachus was a rhetorical teacher,
who had devised precepts respecting the construction of an oration
and the training of young men for public speaking. It is most
probable that he confined himself, like Gorgias, to this department,
and that he did not profess to give moral lectures, like Protagoras
and Prodikus. But granting him to have given such, he would not
talk about justice in the way in which Plato makes him talk, if he
desired to give any satisfaction to an Athenian audience. The mere
brutality and ferocious impudence of demeanor even to exaggeration,
with which Plato invests him, is in itself a strong proof that the
doctrine, ushered in with such a preface, was not that of a popular
and acceptable teacher, winning favor in public audiences. He defines
justice to be “the interest of the superior power; that rule, which,
in every society, the dominant power prescribes, as being for its own
advantage.” A man is just, he says, for the advantage of another, not
for his own: he is weak, cannot help himself,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span> and must submit to that which the
stronger authority, whether despot, oligarchy, or commonwealth,
commands.</p>

<p>This theory is essentially different from the doctrine of
Kalliklês, as set forth <a href="#Kalli">a few pages</a> back; for
Thrasymachus does not travel out of society to insist upon anterior
rights dating from a supposed state of nature; he takes societies as
he finds them, recognizing the actual governing authority of each
as the canon and constituent of justice or injustice. Stallbaum and
other writers have incautiously treated the two theories as if they
were the same; and with something even worse than want of caution,
while they pronounce the theory of Thrasymachus to be detestably
immoral, announce it as having been propounded not by him only,
but by <i>The Sophists</i>; thus, in their usual style, dealing with
the sophists as if they were a school, sect, or partnership with
mutual responsibility. Whoever has followed the evidence which I
have produced respecting Protagoras and Prodikus, will know how
differently these latter handled the question of justice.</p>

<p>But the truth is, that the theory of Thrasymachus, though
incorrect and defective, is not so detestable as these writers
represent. What makes it seem detestable, is the style and manner
in which he is made to put it forward; which causes the just man to
appear petty and contemptible, while it surrounds the unjust man with
enviable attributes. Now this is precisely the circumstance which
revolts the common sentiments of mankind, as it revolts also the
critics who read what is said by Thrasymachus. The moral sentiments
exist in men’s minds in complex and powerful groups, associated
with some large words and emphatic forms of speech. Whether an
ethical theory satisfies the exigencies of reason, or commands and
answers to all the phenomena, a common audience will seldom give
themselves the trouble to consider with attention; but what they
imperiously exact, and what is indispensable to give the theory any
chance of success, is, that it shall exhibit to their feelings the
just man as respectable and dignified, and the unjust man as odious
and repulsive. Now that which offends in the language ascribed to
Thrasymachus is, not merely the absence, but the reversal, of this
condition; the presentation of the just man as weak and silly, and
of injustice in all the <i>prestige</i> of triumph and dignity. And
for this very reason, I venture to infer that such a theory<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span> was never propounded
by Thrasymachus to any public audience in the form in which it
appears in Plato. For Thrasymachus was a rhetor, who had studied the
principles of his art: now we know that these common sentiments of
an audience, were precisely what the rhetors best understood, and
always strove to conciliate. Even from the time of Gorgias, they
began the practice of composing beforehand declamations upon the
general heads of morality, which were ready to be introduced into
actual speeches as occasion presented itself, and in which appeal
was made to the moral sentiments foreknown as common, with more
or less of modification, to all the Grecian assemblies. The real
Thrasymachus, addressing any audience at Athens, would never have
wounded these sentiments, as the Platonic Thrasymachus is made to do
in the “Republic.” Least of all would he have done this, if it be
true of him, as Plato asserts of the rhetors and sophists generally,
that they thought about nothing but courting popularity, without any
sincerity of conviction.</p>

<p>Though Plato thinks fit to bring out the opinion of Thrasymachus
with accessories unnecessarily offensive, and thus to enhance
the dialectical triumph of Sokratês by the brutal manners of the
adversary, he was well aware that he had not done justice to the
opinion itself, much less confuted it. The proof of this is, that
in the second book of the “Republic,” after Thrasymachus has
disappeared, the very same opinion is taken up by Glaukon and
Adeimantus, and set forth by both of them, though they disclaim
entertaining it as their own, as suggesting grave doubts and
difficulties which they desire to hear solved by Sokratês. Those
who read attentively the discourses of Glaukon and Adeimantus, will
see that the substantive opinion ascribed to Thrasymachus, apart
from the brutality with which he is made to state it, does not even
countenance the charge of immoral teaching against <i>him</i>, much
less against the sophists generally. Hardly anything in Plato’s
compositions is more powerful than those discourses. They present,
in a perspicuous and forcible manner, some of the most serious
difficulties with which ethical theory is required to grapple. And
Plato can answer them only in one way, by taking society to pieces,
and reconstructing it in the form of his imaginary republic. The
speeches of Glaukon and Adeimantus form the immediate preface
to the striking and elaborate description<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span> which he goes through, of his new
state of society, nor do they receive any other answer than what
is implied in that description. Plato indirectly confesses that
he cannot answer them, assuming social institutions to continue
unreformed: and his reform is sufficiently fundamental.<a
id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span></p> <p>I
call particular attention to this circumstance, without which we
cannot fairly estimate the sophists, or practical teachers of
Athens, face to face with their accuser-general, Plato. He was a
great and systematic theorist, whose opinions on ethics, politics,
cognition, religion, etc., were all wrought into harmony by his
own mind, and stamped with that peculiarity which is the mark of
an original intellect. So splendid an effort of speculative genius
is among the marvels of the Grecian world. His dissent from all
the societies which he saw around him, not merely democratical,
but oligarchical and despotic also, was of the deepest and most
radical character. Nor did he delude himself by the belief, that any
partial amendment of that which he saw around could bring about the
end which he desired: he looked to nothing short of a new genesis
of the man and the citizen, with institutions calculated from the
beginning to work out the full measure of perfectibility. His
fertile scientific imagination realized this idea in the “Republic.”
But that very systematic and original char<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span>acter, which lends so much value and
charm to the substantive speculations of Plato, counts as a deduction
from his trustworthiness as critic or witness, in reference to the
living agents whom he saw at work in Athens and other cities, as
statesmen, generals, or teachers. His criticisms are dictated by
his own point of view, according to which the entire society was
corrupt, and all the instruments who carried on its functions were
of essentially base metal. Whoever will read either the “Gorgias” or
the “Republic,” will see in how sweeping and indiscriminate a manner
he passes his sentence of condemnation. Not only all the sophists
and all the rhetors,<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617"
class="fnanchor">[617]</a> but all the musicians and dithyrambic
or tragic poets; all the statesmen, past as well as present, not
excepting even the great Periklês, receive from his hands one common
stamp of dishonor. Every one of these men are numbered by Plato among
the numerous category of flatterers, who minister to the immediate
gratification and to the desires of the people, without looking
to their permanent improvement, or making them morally better.
“Periklês and Kimon (says Sokratês in the “Gorgias”) are nothing
but servants or ministers who supply the immediate appetites and
tastes of the people; just as the baker and the confectioner do in
their respective departments, without knowing or caring whether the
food will do any real good, a point which the physician alone can
determine. As ministers, they are clever enough: they have provided
the city amply with tribute, walls, docks, ships, and <i>such other
follies</i>: but I (Sokratês) am the only man in Athens who aim, so far
as my strength permits, at the true purpose of politics, the mental
improvement of the people.”<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618"
class="fnanchor">[618]</a> So wholesale a condemna<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span>tion betrays itself
as the offspring, and the consistent offspring, of systematic
peculiarity of vision, the prejudice of a great and able mind.</p>

<p>It would be not less unjust to appreciate the sophists or the
statesmen of Athens from the point of view of Plato, than the
present teachers and politicians of England or France from that
of Mr. Owen or Fourier. Both the one and the other class labored
for society as it stood at Athens: the statesmen carried on the
business of practical politics, the sophist trained up youth for
practical life in all its departments, as family men, citizens, and
leaders, to obey as well as to command. Both accepted the system as
it stood, without contemplating the possibility of a new birth of
society: both ministered to certain exigences, held their anchorage
upon certain sentiments, and bowed to a certain morality, actually
felt among the living men around them. That which Plato says of the
statesmen of Athens is perfectly true, that they were only servants
or ministers of the people. He, who tried the people and the entire
society by comparison with an imaginary standard of his own, might
deem all these ministers worthless in the lump, as carrying on a
system too bad to be mended; but, nevertheless, the difference
between a competent and an incompetent minister, between Periklês
and Nikias, was of unspeakable moment to the security and happiness
of the Athenians. What the sophists on their part undertook was, to
educate young men so as to make them better qualified for statesmen
or ministers; and Protagoras would have thought it sufficient honor
to himself,—as well as sufficient benefit to Athens, which assuredly
it would have been,—if he could have inspired any young Athenian with
the soul and the capacities of his friend and companion Periklês.</p>

<p>So far is Plato from considering the sophists as the corruptors
of Athenian morality, that he distinctly protests against that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p. 396]</span> supposition, in a
remarkable passage of the “Republic.” It is, he says, the whole
people, or the society, with its established morality, intelligence,
and tone of sentiment, which is intrinsically vicious; the teachers
of such a society must be vicious also, otherwise their teaching
would not be received; and even if their private teaching were
ever so good, its effect would be washed away, except in some
few privileged natures, by the overwhelming deluge of pernicious
social influences.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619"
class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Nor let any one imagine, as modern readers
are but too ready to understand it, that this poignant censure is
intended for Athens so far forth as a democracy. Plato was not
the man to preach king-worship, or wealth-worship, as social or
political remedies: he declares emphatically that not one of the
societies then existing was such that a truly philosophical nature
could be engaged in active functions under it.<a id="FNanchor_620"
href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> These passages would
be alone sufficient to repel the assertions of those who denounce the
sophists as poisoners of Athenian morality, on the alleged authority
of Plato.</p>

<p>Nor is it at all more true that they were men of mere words, and
made their pupils no better,—a charge just as vehemently pressed
against Sokratês as against the sophists,—and by the same class of
enemies, such as Anytus,<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621"
class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Aristophanês, Eupolis, etc. It was
mainly from sophists like Hippias that the Athenian youth learned
what they knew of geometry, astronomy, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span> arithmetic: but the range of what is
called special science, possessed even by the teacher, was at that
time very limited; and the matter of instruction communicated was
expressed under the general title of “Words, or Discourses,” which
were always taught by the sophists, in connection with thought, and
in reference to a practical use. The capacities of thought, speech,
and action, are conceived in conjunction by Greeks generally, and by
teachers like Isokratês and Quintilian especially; and when young men
in Greece, like the Bœotian Proxenus, put themselves under training
by Gorgias or any other sophist, it was with a view of qualifying
themselves, not merely to speak, but to act.<a id="FNanchor_622"
href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>Most of the pupils of the sophists, as of Sokratês<a
id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
himself, were young men of wealth; a fact, at which Plato sneers, and
others copy him, as if it proved that they cared only about high pay.
But I do not hesitate to range myself on the side of Isokratês,<a
id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
and to contend that the sophist himself had much to lose by
corrupting his pupils,—an argument used by Sokratês in defending
himself before the dikastery, and just as valid in defence of
Protagoras or Prodikus,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625"
class="fnanchor">[625]</a>—and strong personal interest in sending
them forth accomplished and virtuous; that the best-taught youth
were decidedly the most free from crime and the most active towards
good; that among the valuable ideas and feelings which a young
Athenian had in his mind, as well as among the good pursuits which
he followed, those which he learned from the sophists counted nearly
as the best; that, if the contrary had been the fact, fathers would
not have continued so to send their sons, and pay their money. It was
not merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span> that
these teachers countervailed in part the temptations to dissipated
enjoyment, but also that they were personally unconcerned in the
acrimonious slander and warfare of party in his native city; that
the topics with which they familiarized him were, the general
interests and duties of men and citizens; that they developed the
germs of morality in the ancient legends, as in Prodikus’s fable,
and amplified in his mind all the undefined cluster of associations
connected with the great words of morality; that they vivified in
him the sentiment of Pan-Hellenic brotherhood; and that, in teaching
him the art of persuasion,<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a> they could not but make him feel the
dependence in which he stood towards those who were to be persuaded,
together with the necessity under which he lay of so conducting
himself as to conciliate their good-will.</p>

<p>The intimations given in Plato, of the enthusiastic reception
which Protagoras, Prodikus, and other sophists<a id="FNanchor_627"
href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> met with in the
various cities; the description which we read, in the dialogue called
Protagoras, of the impatience of the youthful Hippokratês, on hearing
of the arrival of that sophist, insomuch that he awakens Sokratês
before daylight, in order to obtain an introduction to the new-comer
and profit by his teaching; the readiness of such rich young men
to pay money, and to devote time and trouble, for the purpose of
acquiring a personal superiority apart from their wealth and station;
the ardor with which Kallias is represented as employing his house
for the hospitable entertainment, and his fortune for the aid, of
the sophists; all this makes upon my mind an impression directly the
reverse of that ironical and contemptuous phraseology with which
it is set forth by Plato. Such sophists had nothing to recommend
them except superior knowledge and intellectual force, combined
with an imposing personality, making itself felt in their lectures
and conversation. It is to this that the admiration was shown; and
the fact that it was so shown, brings to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> view the best attributes of the Greek,
especially the Athenian mind. It exhibits those qualities of which
Periklês made emphatic boast in his celebrated funeral oration;<a
id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
conception of public speech as a practical thing, not meant as
an excuse for inaction, but combined with energetic action, and
turning it to good account by full and open discussion beforehand;
profound sensibility to the charm of manifested intellect, without
enervating the powers of execution or endurance. Assuredly, a man
like Protagoras, arriving in a city with all this train of admiration
laid before him, must have known very little of his own interest or
position, if he began to preach a low or corrupt morality. If it be
true generally, as Voltaire has remarked, that “any man who should
come to preach a relaxed morality would be pelted,” much more would
it be true of a sophist like Protagoras, arriving in a foreign city
with all the prestige of a great intellectual name, and with the
imagination of youths on fire to hear and converse with him, that
any similar doctrine would destroy his reputation at once. Numbers
of teachers have made their reputation by inculcating overstrained
asceticism; it will be hard to find an example of success in the
opposite vein.</p>

<p class="ti0"><span class="smcap">That</span> the professional
teachers called sophists, in Greece, were intellectual and moral
corruptors, and that much corruption grew up under their teaching in
the Athenian mind, are common statements, which I have endeavored to
show to be erroneous. Corresponding to these statements is another,
which repre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span>sents
Sokratês as one whose special merit it was to have rescued the
Athenian mind from such demoralizing influences; a reputation
which he neither deserves nor requires. In general, the favorable
interpretation of evidence, as exhibited towards Sokratês, has been
scarcely less marked than the harshness of presumption against the
sophists. Of late, however, some authors have treated his history
in an altered spirit, and have manifested a disposition to lower
him down to that which they regard as the sophistical level. M.
Forchhammer’s treatise: “The Athenians and Sokratês, or Lawful
Dealing against Revolution,” goes even further, and maintains
confidently that Sokratês was most justly condemned as an heretic,
a traitor, and a corrupter of youth. His book, the conclusions of
which I altogether reject, is a sort of retribution to the sophists,
as extending to their alleged opponent the same bitter and unfair
spirit of construction with that under which they have so long
unjustly suffered. But when we impartially consider the evidence, it
will appear that Sokratês deserves our admiration and esteem; not,
indeed, as an anti-sophist, but as combining with the qualities of a
good man, a force of character and an originality of speculation as
well as of method, and a power of intellectually working on others,
generically different from that of any professional teacher, without
parallel either among contemporaries or successors.</p>

<p>The life of Sokratês comprises seventy years, from 469 to 399
<small>B.C.</small> His father, Sophroniskus, being a
sculptor, the son began by following the same profession, in which
he attained sufficient proficiency to have executed various works;
especially a draped group of the Charites, or Graces, preserved in
the acropolis, and shown as his work down to the time of Pausanias.<a
id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
His mother, Phænaretê, was a midwife, and he had a brother
by the mother’s side named Patroklês.<a id="FNanchor_630"
href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Respecting his wife
Xanthippê, and his three sons, all that has passed into history is
the violent temper of the former, and the patience of her husband
in enduring it. The position and family of Sokratês, without
being absolutely poor, were humble and unimportant but he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span> was of genuine Attic
breed, belonging to the ancient gens Dædalidæ, which took its name
from Dædalus, the mythical artist as progenitor.</p>

<p>The personal qualities of Sokratês, on the other hand, were
marked and distinguishing, not less in body than in mind. His
physical constitution was healthy, robust, and enduring, to an
extraordinary degree. He was not merely strong and active as an
hoplite on military service, but capable of bearing fatigue or
hardship, and indifferent to heat or cold, in a measure which
astonished all his companions. He went barefoot in all seasons of
the year, even during the winter campaign at Potidæa, under the
severe frosts of Thrace; and the same homely clothing sufficed to
him for winter as well as for summer. Though his diet was habitually
simple as well as abstemious, yet there were occasions, of religious
festival or friendly congratulation, on which every Greek considered
joviality and indulgence to be becoming. On such occasions, Sokratês
could drink more wine than any guest present, yet without being
overcome or intoxicated.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631"
class="fnanchor">[631]</a> He abstained, on principle, from
all extreme gymnastic training, which required, as necessary
condition, extraordinary abundance of food.<a id="FNanchor_632"
href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> It was his professed
purpose to limit, as much as possible, the number of his wants, as a
distant approach to the perfection of the gods, who wanted nothing,
to control such as were natural, and prevent the multiplication of
any that were artificial.<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633"
class="fnanchor">[633]</a> Nor can there be any doubt that his
admirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> bodily
temperament contributed materially to facilitate such a purpose,
and assist him in the maintenance of that self-mastery, contented
self-sufficiency, and independence of the favor<a id="FNanchor_634"
href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> as well as of the
enmity of others, which were essential to his plan of intellectual
life. His friends, who communicate to us his great bodily strength
and endurance, are at the same time full of jests upon his ugly
physiognomy; his flat nose, thick lips, and prominent eyes, like
a satyr, or silenus.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635"
class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Nor can we implicitly trust the evidence
of such very admiring witnesses, as to the philosopher’s exemption
from infirmities of temper; for there seems good proof that he was by
natural temperament violently irascible; a defect which he generally
kept under severe control, but which occasionally betrayed him into
great improprieties of language and demeanor.<a id="FNanchor_636"
href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>Of those friends, the best known to us are Xenophon and Plato,
though there existed in antiquity various dialogues com<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span>posed, and memoranda put
together, by other hearers of Sokratês, respecting his conversations
and teaching, which are all now lost.<a id="FNanchor_637"
href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The “Memorabilia” of
Xenophon profess to record actual conversations held by Sokratês, and
are prepared with the announced purpose of vindicating him against
the accusations of Melêtus and his other accusers on the trial, as
well as against unfavorable opinions, seemingly much circulated
respecting his character and purposes. We thus have in it a sort of
partial biography, subject to such deductions from its evidentiary
value as may be requisite for imperfection of memory, intentional
decoration, and partiality. On the other hand, the purpose of Plato,
in the numerous dialogues wherein he introduces Sokratês, is not so
clear, and is explained very differently by different commentators.
Plato was a great speculative genius, who came to form opinions of
his own distinct from those of Sokratês, and employed the name of
the latter as spokesman for these opinions in various dialogues. How
much, in the Platonic Sokratês, can be safely accepted either as a
picture of the man or as a record of his opinions,—how much, on the
other hand, is to be treated as Platonism; or in what proportions the
two are intermingled,—is a point not to be decided with certainty or
rigor. The “Apology of Sokratês,” the “Kriton,” and the “Phædon,”—in
so far as it is a moral picture, and apart from the doctrines
advocated in it,—appear to belong to the first category; while the
political and social views of the “Republic” and of the treatise “De
Legibus,” the cosmic theories in the “Timæus,” and the hypothesis of
Ideas, as substantive existences apart from the phenomenal world,
in the various dialogues wherever it is stated, certainly belong to
the second. Of the ethical dialogues, much<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span> may be probably taken to represent
Sokratês, more or less Platonized.</p>

<p>But though the opinions put by Plato into the mouth of Sokratês
are liable to thus much of uncertainty, we find, to our great
satisfaction, that the pictures given by Plato and Xenophon of
their common master are in the main accordant; differing only as
drawn from the same original by two authors radically different
in spirit and character. Xenophon, the man of action, brings out
at length those conversations of Sokratês which had a bearing on
practical conduct, and were calculated to correct vice or infirmity
in particular individuals; such being the matter which served
his purpose as an apologist, at the same time that it suited his
intellectual taste. But he intimates, nevertheless, very plainly,
that the conversation of Sokratês was often, indeed usually,
of a more negative, analytical, and generalizing tendency;<a
id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> not
destined for the reproof of positive or special defect, but to awaken
the inquisitive faculties and lead to the rational comprehension of
vice and virtue as referable to determinate general principles. Now
this latter side of the master’s physiognomy, which Xenophon records
distinctly, though without emphasis or development, acquires almost
exclusive prominence in the Platonic picture. Plato leaves out the
practical, and consecrates himself to the theoretical, Sokratês;
whom he divests in part of his identity, in order to enrol him as
chief speaker in certain larger theoretical views of his own. The
two pictures, therefore, do not contradict each other, but mutually
supply each other’s defects, and admit of being blended into one
consistent whole. And respecting the method of Sokratês, a point more
characteristic than either his precepts or his theory,—as well as
respecting the effect of that method on the minds of hearers,—both
Xenophon and Plato are witnesses substantially in unison: though,
here again, the latter has made the method his own,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span> worked it out on a
scale of enlargement and perfection, and given to it a permanence
which it could never have derived from its original author, who only
talked and never wrote. It is fortunate that our two main witnesses
about him, both speaking from personal knowledge, agree to so great
an extent.</p>

<p>Both describe in the same manner his private life and habits; his
contented poverty, justice, temperance in the largest sense of the
word, and self-sufficing independence of character. On most of these
points too, Aristophanês and the other comic writers, so far as their
testimony counts for anything, appear as confirmatory witnesses;
for they abound in jests on the coarse fare, shabby and scanty
clothing, bare feet, pale face, poor and joyless life, of Sokratês.<a
id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Of the circumstances of his life we are almost wholly ignorant: he
served as an hoplite at Potidæa, at Delium, and at Amphipolis; with
credit apparently in all, though exaggerated encomiums on the part of
his friends provoked an equally exaggerated skepticism on the part
of Athenæus and others. He seems never to have filled any political
office until the year (<small>B.C.</small> 406) in which
the battle of Arginusæ occurred, in which year he was member of the
senate of Five Hundred, and one of the prytanes on that memorable
day when the proposition of Kallixenus against the six generals was
submitted to the public assembly: his determined refusal, in spite
of all personal hazard, to put an unconstitutional question to the
vote, has been already recounted. That during his long life he
strictly obeyed the laws,<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640"
class="fnanchor">[640]</a> is proved by the fact that none of his
numerous enemies ever arraigned him before a court of justice:
that he discharged all the duties of an upright man and a brave
as well as pious citizen, may also be confidently asserted. His
friends lay especial stress upon his piety; that is, upon his exact
discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span> of all
the religious duties considered as incumbent upon an Athenian.<a
id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>Though these points are requisite to be established, in order
that we may rightly interpret the character of Sokratês, it is
not from them that he has derived his eminent place in history.
Three peculiarities distinguish the man. 1. His long life passed
in contented poverty, and in public, apostolic dialectics. 2. His
strong religious persuasion, or belief, of acting under a mission and
signs from the gods; especially his dæmon, or genius; the special
religious warning of which he believed himself to be frequently the
subject. 3. His great intellectual originality, both of subject and
of method, and his power of stirring and forcing the germ of inquiry
and ratiocination in others. Though these three characteristics
were so blended in Sokratês that it is not easy to consider them
separately; yet, in each respect, he stood distinguished from all
Greek philosophers before or after him.</p>

<p>At what time Sokratês relinquished his profession as a statuary we
do not know; but it is certain that all the middle and later part of
his life, at least, was devoted exclusively to the self-imposed task
of teaching; excluding all other business, public or private, and to
the neglect of all means of fortune. We can hardly avoid speaking of
him as a teacher, though he himself disclaimed the appellation:<a
id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
his practice was to talk or converse, or <i>to prattle without end</i>,<a
id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> if
we translate the derisory word by which the enemies of philosophy
described dialectic conversation. Early in the morning he frequented
the public walks, the gymnasia for bodily training, and the schools
where youths were receiving instruction: he was to be seen in
the market-place at the hour when it was most crowded, among the
booths and tables where goods were exposed for sale: his whole day
was usually spent in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p.
407]</span> public manner.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644"
class="fnanchor">[644]</a> He talked with any one, young or old,
rich or poor, who sought to address him, and in the hearing of all
who chose to stand by: not only he never either asked or received
any reward, but he made no distinction of persons, never withheld
his conversation from any one, and talked upon the same general
topics to all. He conversed with politicians, sophists, military
men, artisans, ambitious or studious youths, etc. He visited all
persons of interest in the city, male or female: his friendship with
Aspasia is well known, and one of the most interesting chapters<a
id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
of Xenophon’s Memorabilia recounts his visit to and dialogue with
Theodotê, a beautiful hetæra, or female companion. Nothing could be
more public, perpetual, and indiscriminate as to persons than his
conversation. But as it was engaging, curious, and instructive to
hear, certain persons made it their habit to attend him in public
as companions and listeners. These men, a fluctuating body, were
commonly known as his disciples, or scholars; though neither he
nor his personal friends ever employed the terms <i>teacher</i> and
<i>disciple</i> to describe the relation between them.<a id="FNanchor_646"
href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Many of them came,
attracted by his reputation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p.
408]</span> during the later years of his life, from other Grecian
cities; Megara, Thebes, Elis, Kyrênê, etc.</p>

<p>Now no other person in Athens, or in any other Grecian city,
appears ever to have manifested himself in this perpetual and
indiscriminate manner as a public talker for instruction. All
teachers either took money for their lessons, or at least gave them
apart from the multitude in a private house or garden, to special
pupils, with admissions and rejections at their own pleasure. By
the peculiar mode of life which Sokratês pursued, not only his
conversation reached the minds of a much wider circle, but he
became more abundantly known as a person. While acquiring a few
attached friends and admirers, and raising a certain intellectual
interest in others, he at the same time provoked a large number of
personal enemies. This was probably the reason why he was selected
by Aristophanês and the other comic writers, to be attacked as a
general representative of philosophical and rhetorical teaching; the
more so, as his marked and repulsive physiognomy admitted so well
of being imitated in the mask which the actor wore. The audience at
the theatre would more readily recognize the peculiar figure which
they were accustomed to see every day in the market-place, than if
Prodikus or Protagoras, whom most of them did not know by sight, had
been brought on the stage; nor was it of much importance, either to
them or to Aristophanês, whether Sokratês was represented as teaching
what he did really teach, or something utterly different.</p>

<p>This extreme publicity of life and conversation was one among the
characteristics of Sokratês, distinguishing him from all teachers
either before or after him. Next, was his persuasion of a special
religious mission, restraints, impulses, and communications, sent to
him by the gods. Taking the belief in such supernatural intervention
generally, it was indeed noway peculiar to Sokratês: it was the
ordinary faith of the ancient world; insomuch that the attempts to
resolve phenomena into general laws were looked upon with a certain
disapprobation, as indirectly setting it aside. And Xenophon<a
id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
accordingly avails himself of this general fact, in replying to the
indictment for religious innovation, of which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span> his master was found guilty, to affirm
that the latter pretended to nothing beyond what was included in
the creed of every pious man. But this is not an exact statement of
the matter in debate; for it slurs over at least, if it does not
deny, that speciality of inspiration from the gods, which those
who talked with Sokratês—as we learn even from Xenophon—believed,
and which Sokratês himself believed also.<a id="FNanchor_648"
href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> Very different is his
own representation, as put forth in the defence before the dikastery.
He had been accustomed constantly to hear, even from his childhood,
a divine voice, interfering, at moments when he was about to act,
in the way of restraint, but never in the way of instigation. Such
prohibitory warning was wont to come upon him very frequently, not
merely on great, but even on small occasions, intercepting what he
was about to do or to say.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649"
class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Though later writers speak<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span> of this as the dæmon
or genius of Sokratês, he himself does not personify it, but treats
it merely as a “divine sign, a prophetic or supernatural voice.”<a
id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> He
was accustomed not only to obey it implicitly, but to speak of it
publicly and familiarly to others, so that the fact was well known
both to his friends and to his enemies. It had always forbidden him
to enter on public life; it forbade him, when the indictment was
hanging over him, to take any thought for a prepared defence;<a
id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
and so completely did he march with a consciousness of this bridle
in his mouth, that when he felt no check, he assumed that the
turning which he was about to take was the right one. Though his
persuasion on the subject was unquestionably sincere, and his
obedience constant, yet he never dwelt upon it himself as anything
grand, or awful, or entitling him to peculiar deference; but spoke
of it often in his usual strain of familiar playfulness. To his
friends generally, it seems to have constituted one of his titles to
reverence, though neither Plato nor Xenophon scruple to talk of it
in that jesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span>
way which doubtless they caught from himself.<a id="FNanchor_652"
href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> But to his enemies
and to the Athenian public, it appeared in the light of an offensive
heresy; an impious innovation on the orthodox creed, and a desertion
of the recognized gods of Athens.</p>

<p>Such was the dæmon or genius of Sokratês, as described by himself
and as conceived in the genuine Platonic dialogues; a voice always
prohibitory, and bearing exclusively upon his own personal conduct.<a
id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
That which Plutarch and other admirers of Sokratês conceived as a
dæmon, or intermediate being between gods and men, was looked upon
by the fathers of the Christian church as a devil; by LeClerc,
as one of the fallen angels; by some other modern commentators,
as mere ironical phraseology on the part of Sokratês himself.<a
id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
Without presuming to determine the question raised in the former
hypotheses, I believe the last to be untrue, and that the conviction
of Sokratês on the point was quite sincere. A circumstance little
attended to, but deserving peculiar notice, and stated by himself,
is, that the restraining voice began when he was a child, and
continued even down to the end of his life: it had thus become an
established persuasion, long before his philosophical habits began.
But though this peculiar form of inspiration belonged exclusively to
him, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span>
also other ways in which he believed himself to have received the
special mandates of the gods, not simply checking him when he was
about to take a wrong turn, but spurring him on, directing, and
peremptorily exacting from him, a positive course of proceeding.
Such distinct mission had been imposed upon him by dreams, by
oracular intimations, and by every other means which the gods
employed for signifying their special will.<a id="FNanchor_655"
href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p id="Chaere">Of these intimations from the oracle, he specifies
particularly one, in reply to a question put at Delphi, by his
intimate friend, and enthusiastic admirer, Chærephon. The question
put was, whether any other man was wiser than Sokratês; to which
the Pythian priestess replied, that no other man was wiser.<a
id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
Sokratês affirms that he was greatly perplexed on hearing this
declaration from so infallible an authority, being conscious to
himself that he possessed no wisdom on any subject, great or small.
At length, after much meditation and a distressing mental struggle,
he resolved to test the accuracy of the infallible priestess, by
taking measure of the wisdom of others as compared with his own.
Selecting a leading politician, accounted wise both by others and
by himself, he proceeded to converse with him and put scrutinizing
questions; the answers to which satisfied him that this man’s
supposed wisdom was really no wisdom at all. Having made such a
discovery, Sokratês next tried to demonstrate to the politician
himself how much he wanted of being wise; but this was impossible;
the latter still remained as fully persuaded of his own wisdom as
before. “The result which I acquired (says Sokratês) was, that I
was a wiser man than he, for neither he nor I knew anything of what
was truly good and honorable; but the difference between us was,
that he fancied he knew them, while I was fully conscious of my own
ignorance; I was thus wiser than he, inasmuch as I was exempt from
that capital error.” So far, therefore, the oracle was proved to be
right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span> Sokratês
repeated the same experiment successively upon a great number of
different persons, especially those in reputation for distinguished
abilities; first, upon political men and rhetors, next upon poets of
every variety, and upon artists as well as artisans. The result of
his trial was substantially the same in all cases. The poets, indeed,
composed splendid verses, but when questioned even about the words,
the topics, and the purpose, of their own compositions, they could
give no consistent or satisfactory explanations; so that it became
evident that they spoke or wrote, like prophets, as unconscious
subjects under the promptings of inspiration. Moreover, their success
as poets filled them with a lofty opinion of their own wisdom on
other points also. The case was similar with artists and artisans;
who, while highly instructed, and giving satisfactory answers, each
in his own particular employment, were for that reason only the more
convinced that they also knew well other great and noble subjects.
This great general mistake more than countervailed their special
capacities, and left them, on the whole, less wise than Sokratês.<a
id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>“In this research and scrutiny (said Sokratês, on his defence)
I have been long engaged, and am still engaged. I interrogate
every man of reputation; I prove him to be defective in wisdom;
but I cannot prove it so as to make him sensible of the defect.
Fulfilling the mission imposed upon me, I have thus established
the veracity of the god, who meant to pronounce that human wisdom
was of little reach or worth; and that he who, like Sokratês,
felt most convinced of his own worthlessness, as to wisdom, was
really the wisest of men.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658"
class="fnanchor">[658]</a> My service to the god has not only
constrained me to live in constant poverty<a id="FNanchor_659"
href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> and neglect
of political estimation, but has brought upon me a host<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> of bitter enemies in
those whom I have examined and exposed while the bystanders talk of
me as a wise man, because they give me credit for wisdom respecting
all the points on which my exposure of others turns.”—“Whatever be
the danger and obloquy which I may incur, it would be monstrous
indeed, if, having maintained my place in the ranks as an hoplite
under your generals at Delium and Potidæa, I were now, from fear of
death or anything else, to disobey the oracle and desert the post
which the god has assigned to me, the duty of living for philosophy
and cross-questioning both myself and others.<a id="FNanchor_660"
href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> And should you even
now offer to acquit me, on condition of my renouncing this duty,
I should tell you, with all respect and affection, that I will
obey the god rather than you, and that I will persist, until my
dying day, in cross-questioning you, exposing your want of wisdom
and virtue, and reproaching you until the defect be remedied.<a
id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
My mission as your monitor is a mark of the special favor of the
god to you; and if you condemn me, it will be your loss; for you
will find none other such.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662"
class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Perhaps you will ask me, Why cannot you
go away, Sokratês, and live among us in peace and silence? This is
the hardest of all questions for me to answer to your satisfaction.
If I tell you that silence on my part would be disobedience to the
god, you will think me in jest, and not believe me. You will believe
me still less, if I tell you that the greatest blessing which can
happen to man is, to carry on discussions every day about virtue and
those other matters which you hear me canvassing when I cross-examine
myself as well as others; and that life, without such examination,
is no life at all. Nevertheless, so stands the fact, incredible
as it may seem to you.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663"
class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span></p>

<p>I have given rather ample extracts from the Platonic Apology,
because no one can conceive fairly the character of Sokratês who
does not enter into the spirit of that impressive discourse. We see
in it plain evidence of the marked supernatural mission which he
believed himself to be executing, and which would not allow him to
rest or employ himself in other ways. The oracular answer brought
by Chærephon from Delphi, was a fact of far more importance in his
history than his so-called dæmon, about which so much more has
been said. That answer, together with the dreams and other divine
mandates concurrent to the same end, came upon him in the middle
of his life, when the intellectual man was formed, and when he
had already acquired a reputation for wisdom among those who knew
him. It supplied a stimulus which brought into the most pronounced
action a pre-existing train of generalizing dialectics and Zenonian
negation, an intellectual vein with which the religious impulse
rarely comes into confluence. Without such a motive, to which his
mind was peculiarly susceptible, his conversation would probably
have taken the same general turn, but would assuredly have been
restricted within much narrower and more cautious limits. For nothing
could well be more unpopular and obnoxious than the task which he
undertook of cross-examining, and convicting of ignorance, every
distinguished man whom he could approach. So violent, indeed, was the
enmity which he occasionally provoked, that there were instances, we
are told, in which he was struck or maltreated,<a id="FNanchor_664"
href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> and very frequently
laughed to scorn. Though he acquired much admiration from auditors,
especially youthful auditors, and from a few devoted adherents, yet
the philosophical motive alone would not have sufficed to prompt him
to that systematic, and even obtrusive, cross-examination which he
adopted as the business of his life.</p>

<p>This, then, is the second peculiarity which distinguishes
Sokratês, in addition to his extreme publicity of life and
indiscriminate conversation. He was not simply a philosopher, but a
religious missionary doing the work of philosophy; “an elench<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span>tic,—or cross-examining
god,—to use an expression which Plato puts into his mouth respecting
an Eleatic philosopher going about to examine and convict the
infirm in reason.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665"
class="fnanchor">[665]</a> Nothing of this character belonged either
to Parmenidês and Anaxagoras before him, or to Plato and Aristotle
after him. Both Pythagoras and Empedoklês did, indeed, lay claim
to supernatural communications, mingled with their philosophical
teaching. But though there be thus far a general analogy between them
and Sokratês, the modes of manifestation were so utterly different,
that no fair comparison can be instituted.</p>

<p>The third and most important characteristic of Sokratês—that,
through which the first and second became operative—was his
intellectual peculiarity. His influence on the speculative mind of
his age was marked and important; as to subject, as to method, and as
to doctrine.</p>

<p>He was the first who turned his thoughts and discussions
distinctly to the subject of ethics. With the philosophers
who preceded him, the subject of examination had been Nature,
or the Kosmos,<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666"
class="fnanchor">[666]</a> as one undistinguishable whole,
blending together cosmogony, astronomy, geometry, physics,
metaphysics, etc. The Ionic as well as the Eleatic philosophers,
Pythagoras as well as Empedoklês, all set before themselves this
vast and undefined problem; each framing some system suited to
his own vein of imagination; religious, poetical, scientific,
or skeptical. According to that honorable ambition for enlarged
knowledge, however, which marked the century following 480 <small>B.C.</small>, and of which the professional men
called sophists were at once the products and the instruments,
arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, as much as was then known,
were becoming so far detached sciences as to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span> be taught separately to youth.
Such appears to have been the state of science when Sokratês
received his education. He received at least the ordinary amount
of instruction in all:<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667"
class="fnanchor">[667]</a> he devoted himself as a young man to
the society and lessons of the physical philosopher Archelaus,<a
id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> the
disciple of Anaxagoras, whom he accompanied from Athens to Samos;
and there is even reason to believe that, during the earlier part
of his life, he was much devoted to what was then understood as the
general study of Nature.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a> A man of his earnest and active intellect
was likely first to manifest his curiosity as a learner: “to run
after and track the various discourses of others, like a Laconian
hound,” if I may borrow an expression applied to him by Plato,<a
id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a>
before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p. 418]</span>
struck out any novelties of his own. And in Plato’s dialogue called
“Parmenidês,” Sokratês appears as a young man full of ardor for the
discussion of the Parmenidean theory, looking up with reverence
to Parmenidês and Zeno, and receiving from them instructions in
the process of dialectical investigation. I have already, in
the preceding chapter,<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671"
class="fnanchor">[671]</a> noted the tenor of that dialogue, as
illustrating the way in which Grecian philosophy presents itself,
even at the first dawn of dialectics, as at once negative and
positive, recognizing the former branch of method no less than
the latter as essential to the attainment of truth. I construe it
as an indication respecting the early mind of Sokratês, imbibing
this conviction from the ancient Parmenidês and the mature and
practised Zeno, and imposing upon himself, as a condition of assent
to any hypothesis or doctrine, the obligation of setting forth
conscientiously all that could be said against it, not less than
all that could be said in its favor: however laborious such a
process might be, and however little appreciated by the multitude.<a
id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
Little as we know the circumstances which went to form the remarkable
mind of Sokratês, we may infer from this dialogue that he owes in
part his powerful negative vein of dialectics to “the double-tongued
and all-objecting Zeno.”<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673"
class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>To a mind at all exigent on the score of proof, physical
science as handled in that day was indeed likely to appear not
only unsatisfactory, but hopeless; and Sokratês, in the maturity
of his life, deserted it altogether. The contradictory hypotheses
which he heard, with the impenetrable confusion which overhung the
subject, brought him even to the conviction, that the gods intended
the machinery by which they brought about astronomical and physical
results to remain unknown, and that it was impious, as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span> well as useless, to
pry into their secrets.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674"
class="fnanchor">[674]</a> His master Archelaus, though mainly
occupied with physics, also speculated more or less concerning moral
subjects; concerning justice and injustice, the laws, etc.; and
is said to have maintained the tenet, that justice and injustice
were determined by law or convention, not by nature. From him,
perhaps, Sokratês may have been partly led to turn his mind in this
direction. But to a man disappointed with physics, and having in
his bosom a dialectical impulse powerful, unemployed, and restless,
the mere realities of Athenian life, even without Archelaus, would
suggest human relations, duties, action and suffering, as the most
interesting materials for contemplation and discourse. Sokratês
could not go into the public assembly, the dikastery, or even the
theatre, without hearing discussions about what was just or unjust,
honorable or base, expedient or hurtful, etc., nor without having his
mind conducted to the inquiry, what was the meaning of these large
words which opposing disputants often invoked with equal reverential
confidence. Along with the dialectic and generalizing power of
Sokratês, which formed his bond of connection with such minds as
Plato, there was at the same time a vigorous practicality, a large
stock of positive Athenian experience, with which Xenophon chiefly
sympathized, and which he has brought out in his “Memorabilia.” Of
these two intellectual tendencies, combined with a strong religious
sentiment, the character of Sokratês is composed; and all of them
were gratified at once, when he devoted himself to admonitory
interrogation on the rules and purposes of human life; from which
there was the less to divert him, as he had neither talents nor taste
for public speaking.</p>

<p id="human">That “the proper study of mankind is man,”<a id="FNanchor_675"
href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Sokratês was the
first to proclaim: he recognized the security and happiness of man
both as the single end of study, and as the limiting principle<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p. 420]</span> whereby it ought to be
circumscribed. In the present state to which science has attained,
nothing is more curious than to look back at the rules which this
eminent man laid down. Astronomy—now exhibiting the maximum of
perfection, with the largest and most exact power of predicting
future phenomena which human science has ever attained—was pronounced
by him to be among the divine mysteries which it was impossible to
understand, and madness to investigate, as Anaxagoras had foolishly
pretended to do. He admitted, indeed, that there was advantage in
knowing enough of the movements of the heavenly bodies to serve as an
index to the change of seasons, and as guides for voyages, journeys
by land, or night-watches: but thus much, he said, might easily be
obtained from pilots and watchmen, while all beyond was nothing but
waste of valuable time, exhausting that mental effort which ought
to be employed in profitable acquisitions. He reduced geometry to
its literal meaning of land-measuring, necessary so far as to enable
any one to proceed correctly in the purchase, sale, or division of
land, which any man of common attention might do almost without a
teacher; but silly and worthless, if carried beyond, to the study
of complicated diagrams.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676"
class="fnanchor">[676]</a> Respecting arithmetic, he gave the same
qualified permission of study; but as to general physics, or the
study of Nature, he discarded it altogether: “Do these inquirers (he
asked) think that they already know <i>human affairs</i> well enough, that
they thus begin to meddle with <i>divine</i>? Do they think that they
shall be able to excite or calm the winds and the rain at pleasure,
or have they no other view than to gratify an idle curiosity? Surely,
they must see that such matters are beyond human investigation. Let
them only recollect how much the greatest men, who have attempted the
investigation, differ in their pretended results, holding opinions
extreme and opposite to each other, like those of madmen!” Such was
the view which Sokratês took of physical science and its prospects.<a
id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> It
is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span> very same
skepticism in substance, and carried farther in degree, though here
invested with a religious coloring, for which Ritter and others so
severely denounce Gorgias. But looking at matters as they stood in
440-430 <small>B.C.</small>, it ought not to be accounted
even surprising, much less blamable. To an acute man of that day,
physical science as then studied may well be conceived to have
promised no result; and even to have seemed worse than barren, if,
like Sokratês, he had an acute perception how much of human happiness
was forfeited by immorality, and by corrigible ignorance; how much
might be gained by devoting the same amount of earnest study to this
latter object. Nor ought we to omit remarking, that the objection
of Sokratês: “You may judge how unprofitable are these studies, by
observing how widely the students differ among themselves,” remains
in high favor down to the present day, and may constantly be seen
employed against theoretical men, or theoretical arguments, in every
department.</p>

<p>Sokratês desired to confine the studies of his hearers to <i>human</i>
matters as distinguished from <i>divine</i>, the latter comprehending
astronomy and physics. He looked at all knowledge from the point of
view of human practice, which had been assigned by the gods to man
as his proper subject for study and learning, and with reference
to which, therefore, they managed all the current phenomena upon
principles of constant and intelligible sequence, so that every
one who chose to learn, might learn, while those who took no such
pains suffered for their neglect. Even in these, however, the most
careful study was not by itself completely sufficient; for the
gods did not condescend to submit <i>all</i> the phenomena to constant
antecedence and consequence, but reserved to themselves the capital
turns and junctures for special sentence.<a id="FNanchor_678"
href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Yet here again, if
a man had been diligent in learning all that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span> the gods permitted to be learned;
and if, besides, he was assiduous in pious court to them, and in
soliciting special information by way of prophecy, they would
be gracious to him, and signify beforehand how they intended to
act in putting the final hand and in settling the undecipherable
portions of the problem.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679"
class="fnanchor">[679]</a> The kindness of the gods in replying
through their oracles, or sending information by sacrificial
signs or prodigies, in cases of grave difficulty, was, in the
view of Sokratês, one of the most signal evidences of their care
for the human race.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680"
class="fnanchor">[680]</a> To seek access to these prophecies,
or indications of special divine intervention to come, was the
proper supplementary business of any one who had done as much for
himself as could be done by patient study.<a id="FNanchor_681"
href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> But as it was madness
in a man to solicit special information from the gods on matters
which they allowed him to learn by his own diligence, so it was not
less madness in him to investigate as a learner that which they chose
to keep back for their own specialty of will.<a id="FNanchor_682"
href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>Such was the capital innovation made by Sokratês in regard to
the subject of Athenian study, bringing down philosophy, to use
the expression of Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683"
class="fnanchor">[683]</a> from the heavens to the earth; and
such his attempt to draw the line between that which was, and was
not, scientifically discoverable; an attempt remarkable, inasmuch
as it shows his conviction that the scientific and the religious
point of view mutually excluded one another, so that where the
latter began, the former ended. It was an innovation, inestimable,
in respect to the new matter which it let in; of little import,
as regards that which it professed to exclude. For in point of
fact, physical science, though partially discouraged, was never
absolutely excluded, through any prevalence of that systematic
disapproval which he, in common with the multitude of his day,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> entertained: if it
became comparatively neglected, this arose rather from the greater
popularity, and the more abundant and accessible matter, of that
which he introduced. Physical or astronomical science was narrow in
amount, known only to few, and even with those few it did not admit
of being expanded, enlivened, or turned to much profitable account in
discussion. But the moral and political phenomena on which Sokratês
turned the light of speculation were abundant, varied, familiar,
and interesting to every one; comprising—to translate a Greek line
which he was fond of quoting—“all the good and evil which has
befallen you in your home;”<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684"
class="fnanchor">[684]</a> connected too, not merely with the
realities of the present, but also with the literature of the past,
through the gnomic and other poets.</p>

<p>The motives which determined this important innovation, as to
the subject of study, exhibits Sokratês chiefly as a religious man
and a practical, philanthropic preceptor, the Xenophontic hero. His
innovations, not less important, as to method and doctrine, place
before us the philosopher and dialectician; the other side of his
character, or the Platonic hero; faintly traced, indeed, yet still
recognized and identified by Xenophon.</p>

<p>“Sokratês,” says the latter,<a id="FNanchor_685"
href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> “continued
incessantly discussing <i>human</i> affairs (the sense of this word will
be understood by what has been said above, <a href="#human">page
420</a>); investigating: What is piety? What is impiety? What is the
honorable and the base? What is the just and the unjust? What is
temperance or unsound mind? What is courage or cowardice? What is a
city? What is the character fit for a citizen? What is authority over
men? What is the character befitting the exercise of such authority?
and other similar questions. Men who knew these matters he accounted
good and honorable; men who were ignorant of them he assimilated to
slaves.”</p>

<p>Sokratês, says Xenophon again, in another passage, considered
that the <i>dialectic process</i> consisted in coming together and taking
common counsel, to distinguish and distribute things into genera,
or families, so as to learn what each separate thing really was. To
go through this process carefully was indispensable, as the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span> only way of enabling a
man to regulate his own conduct, aiming at good objects and avoiding
bad. To be so practised as to be able to do it readily, was essential
to make a man a good leader or adviser of others. Every man who had
gone through the process, and come to know what each thing was,
could also of course define it and explain it to others; but if
he did not know, it was no wonder that he went wrong himself, and
put others wrong besides.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686"
class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Moreover, Aristotle says: “To Sokratês
we may unquestionably assign two novelties; inductive discourses,
and the definitions of general terms.”<a id="FNanchor_687"
href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span></p>

<p>I borrow here intentionally from Xenophon in preference to Plato;
since the former, tamely describing a process which he imperfectly
appreciated, identifies it so much the more completely with the real
Sokratês, and is thus a better witness than Plato, whose genius
not only conceived but greatly enlarged it, for didactic purposes
of his own. In our present state of knowledge, some mental effort
is required to see anything important in the words of Xenophon; so
familiar has every student been rendered with the ordinary terms and
gradations of logic and classification,—such as genus, definition,
individual things as comprehended in a genus; what each thing is,
and to what genus it belongs, etc. But familiar as these words have
now become, they denote a mental process, of which, in 440-430
<small>B.C.</small>, few men besides Sokratês had any
conscious perception. Of course, men conceived and described things
in classes, as is implied in the very form of language, and in the
habitual junction of predicates with subjects in common speech.
They explained their meaning clearly and forcibly in particular
cases: they laid down maxims, argued questions, stated premises,
and drew conclusions, on trials in the dikastery, or debates in the
assembly: they had an abundant poetical literature, which appealed to
every variety of emotion: they were beginning to compile historical
narrative, intermixed with reflection and criticism. But though
all this was done, and often admirably well done, it was wanting
in that analytical consciousness which would have enabled any one
to describe, explain, or vindicate what he was doing. The ideas of
men—speakers as well as hearers, the productive minds as well as the
recipient multitude—were associated together in groups favorable
rather to emotional results, or to poetical, rhetorical narrative and
descriptive effect, than to methodical generalization, to scientific
conception, or to proof either inductive or deductive. That
reflex act of attention which enables men to understand, compare,
and rectify their own mental process, was only just beginning.
It was a recent novelty on the part of the rhetorical teachers,
to analyze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span>
the component parts of a public harangue, and to propound some
precepts for making men tolerable speakers. Protagoras was just
setting forth various grammatical distinctions, while Prodikus
discriminated the significations of words nearly equivalent and
liable to be confounded. All these proceedings appeared then so new<a
id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> as
to incur the ridicule even of Plato: yet they were branches of that
same analytical tendency which Sokratês now carried into scientific
inquiry. It may be doubted whether any one before him ever used the
words genus and species, originally meaning family and form, in
the philosophical sense now exclusively appropriated to them. Not
one of those many names—called by logicians <i>names of the second
intention</i>—which imply distinct attention to various parts of the
logical process, and enable us to consider and criticize it in
detail, then existed. All of them grew out of the schools of Plato,
Aristotle, and the subsequent philosophers, so that we can thus trace
them in their beginning to the common root and father, Sokratês.</p>

<p>To comprehend the full value of the improvements struck out by
Sokratês, we have only to examine the intellectual paths pursued
by his predecessors or contemporaries. He set to himself distinct
and specific problems: “What is justice? What is piety, courage,
political government? What is it which is really denoted by such
great and important names, bearing upon the conduct or happiness of
man?” Now it has been already remarked that Anaxagoras, Empedoklês,
Demokritus, the Pythagoreans, all had still present to their minds
those vast and undivided problems which had been transmitted
down from the old poets; bending their minds to the invention of
some system which would explain them all at once, or assist the
imagination in conceiving both how the Kosmos first began, and how
it continued to move on.<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689"
class="fnanchor">[689]</a> Ethics and physics, man and nature,
were all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[p. 427]</span>
blended together; and the Pythagoreans, who explained all nature
by numbers and numerical relations, applied the same explanation
to moral attributes, considering justice to be symbolized by a
perfect equation, or by four, the first of all square numbers.<a
id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>
These early philosophers endeavored to find out the beginnings,
the component elements, the moving cause or causes, of
things in the mass;<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691"
class="fnanchor">[691]</a> but the logical distribution into genus,
species, and individuals, does not seem to have suggested itself to
them, or to have been made a subject of distinct attention by any one
before Sokratês. To study ethics, or human dispositions and ends,
apart from the physical world, and according to a theory of their
own, referring to human good and happiness as the sovereign and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span> comprehensive end;<a
id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
to treat each of the great and familiar words designating moral
attributes, as logical aggregates comprehending many judgments in
particular cases, and connoting a certain harmony or consistency of
purpose among the separate judgments, to bring many of these latter
into comparison, by a scrutinizing dialectical process, so as to test
the consistency and completeness of the logical aggregate or general
notion, as it stood in every man’s mind: all these were parts of the
same forward movement which Sokratês originated.</p>

<p>It was at that time a great progress to break down the
unwieldy mass conceived by former philosophers as science; and
to study ethics apart, with a reference, more or less distinct,
to their own appropriate end. Nay, we see, if we may trust the
“Phædon” of Plato,<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693"
class="fnanchor">[693]</a> that Sokratês, before he resolved on such
pronounced severance, had tried to construct, or had at least yearned
after, an undivided and reformed system, including physics also under
the ethical end; a scheme of optimistic physics, applying the general
idea, “<i>What was best</i>,” as the commanding principle, from whence
physical explanations were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[p.
429]</span> to be deduced; which he hoped to find, but did not find,
in Anaxagoras. But it was a still greater advance to seize, and push
out in conscious application, the essential features of that logical
process, upon the correct performance of which all our security
for general truth depends. The notions of genus, subordinate
genera, and individuals as comprehended under them,—we need not
here notice the points on which Plato and Aristotle differed from
each other and from the modern conceptions on that subject,—were
at that time newly brought into clear consciousness in the human
mind. The profusion of logical distribution employed in some of
the dialogues of Plato, such as the Sophistês and the Politicus,
seems partly traceable to his wish to familiarize hearers with that
which was then a novelty, as well as to enlarge its development,
and diversify its mode of application. He takes numerous indirect
opportunities of bringing it out into broad light, by putting into
the mouths of his dialogists answers implying complete inattention to
it, exposed afterwards in the course of the dialogue by Sokratês.<a
id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
What was now begun by Sokratês, and improved by Plato, was embodied
as part in a comprehensive system of formal logic by the genius
of Aristotle; a system which was not only of extraordinary value
in reference to the processes and controversies of its time, but
which also, having become insensibly worked into the minds of
instructed men, has contributed much to form what is correct in the
habits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span> of modern
thinking. Though it has been now enlarged and recast, by some modern
authors—especially by Mr. John Stuart Mill, in his admirable System
of Logic—into a structure commensurate with the vast increase of
knowledge and extension of positive method belonging to the present
day, we must recollect that the distance, between the best modern
logic and that of Aristotle, is hardly so great as that between
Aristotle and those who preceded him by a century, Empedoklês,
Anaxagoras, and the Pythagoreans; and that the movement in advance of
these latter commences with Sokratês.</p>

<p>By Xenophon, by Plato, and by Aristotle, the growth as well as the
habitual use of logical classification is represented as concurrent
with and dependent upon dialectics. In this methodized discussion, so
much in harmony with the marked sociability of the Greek character,
the quick recurrence of short question and answer was needful as
a stimulus to the attention, at a time when the habit of close
and accurate reflection on abstract subjects had been so little
cultivated. But the dialectics of Sokratês had far greater and more
important peculiarities than this. We must always consider his method
in conjunction with the subjects to which he applied it. As those
subjects were not recondite or special, but bore on the practical
life of the house, the market-place, the city, the dikastery, the
gymnasium, or the temple, with which every one was familiar, so
Sokratês never presented himself as a teacher, nor as a man having
new knowledge to communicate. On the contrary, he disclaimed such
pretensions, uniformly and even ostentatiously. But the subjects on
which he talked were just those which every one professed to know
perfectly and thoroughly, and on which every one believed himself in
a condition to instruct others, rather than to require instruction
for himself. On such questions as these: What is justice? What is
piety? What is a democracy? What is a law? every man fancied that
he could give a confident opinion, and even wondered that any other
person should feel a difficulty. When Sokratês, professing ignorance,
put any such question, he found no difficulty in obtaining an answer,
given off-hand, and with very little reflection. The answer purported
to be the explanation or definition of a term—familiar, indeed, but
of wide and comprehensive import—given by one who had never before
tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span> render
to himself an account of what it meant. Having got this answer,
Sokratês put fresh questions, applying it to specific cases, to
which the respondent was compelled to give answers inconsistent
with the first; thus showing that the definition was either too
narrow, or too wide, or defective in some essential condition. The
respondent then amended his answer; but this was a prelude to other
questions, which could only be answered in ways inconsistent with the
amendment; and the respondent, after many attempts to disentangle
himself, was obliged to plead guilty to the inconsistencies, with an
admission that he could make no satisfactory answer to the original
query, which had at first appeared so easy and familiar. Or, if he
did not himself admit this, the hearers at least felt it forcibly.
The dialogue, as given to us, commonly ends with a result purely
negative, proving that the respondent was incompetent to answer the
question proposed to him, in a manner consistent and satisfactory
even to himself. Sokratês, as he professed from the beginning to have
no positive theory to support, so he maintains to the end the same
air of a learner, who would be glad to solve the difficulty if he
could, but regrets to find himself disappointed of that instruction
which the respondent had promised.</p>

<p>We see by this description of the cross-examining path of this
remarkable man, how intimate was the bond of connection between the
dialectic method and the logical distribution of particulars into
species and genera. The discussion first raised by Sokratês turns
upon the meaning of some large generic term, the queries whereby he
follows it up, bring the answer given into collision with various
particulars which it ought not to comprehend, yet does; or with
others, which it ought to comprehend, but does not. It is in this
manner that the latent and undefined cluster of association, which
has grown up round a familiar term, is as it were penetrated by a
fermenting leaven, forcing it to expand into discernible portions,
and bringing the appropriate function which the term ought to fulfil,
to become a subject of distinct consciousness. The inconsistencies
into which the hearer is betrayed in his various answers, proclaim
to him the fact that he has not yet acquired anything like a
clear and full conception of the common attribute which binds
together the various particulars embraced under some term which is
ever upon his lips; or perhaps enable him to detect a different
fact, not less impor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p.
432]</span>tant, that there is no such common attribute, and that
the generalization is merely nominal and fallacious. In either case,
he is put upon the train of thought which leads to a correction
of the generalization, and lights him on to that which Plato<a
id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
calls, seeing the one in the many, and the many in the one. Without
any predecessor to copy, Sokratês, fell as it were instinctively
into that which Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696"
class="fnanchor">[696]</a> describes as the double track of the
dialectic process; breaking up the one into many, and recombining
the many into one; the former duty, at once the first and the most
essential, Sokratês performed directly by his analytical string of
questions; the latter, or synthetical process, was one which he did
not often directly undertake, but strove so to arm and stimulate
the hearer’s mind, as to enable him to do it for himself. This
one and many denote the logical distribution of a multifarious
subject-matter under generic terms, with clear understanding of the
attributes implied or connoted by each term, so as to discriminate
those particulars to which it really applies. At a moment when such
logical distribution was as yet novel as a subject of consciousness,
it could hardly have been probed and laid out in the mind by any less
stringent process than the cross-examining dialectics of Sokratês,
applied to the analysis of some attempts at definition hastily given
by respondents; that “inductive discourse and search for (clear
general notions or) definitions of general terms,” which Aristotle so
justly points out as his peculiar innovation.</p>

<p>I have already adverted to the persuasion of religious
mission under which Sokratês acted in pursuing this system
of conversation and interrogation. He probably began it in
a tentative way,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697"
class="fnanchor">[697]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p.
433]</span> upon a modest scale, and under the pressure of logical
embarrassment weighing on his own mind. But as he proceeded, and
found himself successful, as well as acquiring reputation among a
certain circle of friends, his earnest soul became more and more
penetrated with devotion to that which he regarded as a duty. It was
at this time probably, that his friend Chærephon came back with the
oracular answer from Delphi, noticed <a href="#Chaere">a few pages</a>
above, to which Sokratês himself alludes as having prompted him
to extend the range of his conversation, and to question a class
of persons whom he had not before ventured to approach, the noted
politicians, poets, and artisans. He found them more confident than
humbler individuals in their own wisdom, but quite as unable to reply
to his queries without being driven to contradictory answers.</p>

<p>Such scrutiny of the noted men in Athens is made to stand
prominent in the “Platonic Apology,” because it was the principal
cause of that unpopularity which Sokratês at once laments and
accounts for before the dikasts. Nor can we doubt that it was the
most impressive portion of his proceedings, in the eyes both of
enemies and admirers, as well as the most flattering to his own
natural temper. Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to present this
part of the general purpose of Sokratês—or of his divine mission, if
we adopt his own language—as if it were the whole; and to describe
him as one standing forward merely to unmask select leading men,
politicians, sophists, poets, or others, who had acquired unmerited
reputation, and were puffed up with foolish conceit of their own
abilities, being in reality shallow and incompetent. Such an idea of
Sokratês is at once inadequate and erroneous. His conversation, as I
have before remarked, was absolutely universal and indiscriminate;
while the mental defect which he strove to rectify was one not at
all peculiar to leading men, but common to them with the mass of
mankind, though seeming to be exaggerated in them, partly because
more is expected from them, partly because the general feeling of
self-estimation stands at a higher level, naturally and reasonably,
in their bosoms, than in those of ordinary persons. That defect
was, the “seeming and conceit of knowledge without the reality,” on
human life with its duties, purposes, and con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span>ditions; the knowledge of which Sokratês
called emphatically “human wisdom,” and regarded as essential to the
dignity of a freeman; while he treated other branches of science as
above the level of man,<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698"
class="fnanchor">[698]</a> and as a stretch of curiosity, not merely
superfluous, but reprehensible. His warfare against such false
persuasion of knowledge, in one man as well as another, upon those
subjects—for with him, I repeat, we must never disconnect the method
from the subjects—clearly marked even in Xenophon, is abundantly
and strikingly illustrated by the fertile genius of Plato, and
constituted the true missionary scheme which pervaded the last half
of his long life; a scheme far more comprehensive, as well as more
generous, than those anti-sophistic polemics which are assigned to
him by so many authors as his prominent object.<a id="FNanchor_699"
href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>In pursuing the thread of his examination, there was no topic upon
which Sokratês more frequently insisted, than the contrast<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span> between the state of
men’s knowledge on the general topics of man and society, and that
which artists or professional men possessed in their respective
special crafts. So perpetually did he reproduce this comparison, that
his enemies accused him of wearing it threadbare.<a id="FNanchor_700"
href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Take a man of special
vocation—a carpenter, a brazier, a pilot, a musician, a surgeon—and
examine him on the state of his professional knowledge, you will find
him able to indicate the persons from whom and the steps by which
he first acquired it: he can describe to you his general aim, with
the particular means which he employs to realize the aim, as well
as the reason why such means must be employed and why precautions
must be taken to combat such and such particular obstructions: he
can teach his profession to others: in matters relating to his
profession, he counts as an authority, so that no extra-professional
person thinks of contesting the decision of a surgeon in case of
disease, or of a pilot at sea. But while such is the fact in regard
to every special art, how great is the contrast in reference to the
art of righteous, social, and useful living, which forms, or ought
to form, the common business alike important to each and to all!
On this subject, Sokratês<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701"
class="fnanchor">[701]</a> remarked that every<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span> one felt perfectly well-informed,
and confident in his own knowledge; yet no one knew from whom, or
by what steps, he had learned: no one had ever devoted any special
reflection either to ends, or means, or obstructions: no one could
explain or give a consistent account of the notions in his own
mind, when pertinent questions were put to him: no one could teach
another, as might be inferred, he thought, from the fact that there
were no professed teachers, and that the sons of the best men were
often destitute of merit: every one knew for himself, and laid
down general propositions confidently, without looking up to any
other man as knowing better; yet there was no end of dissension and
dispute on particular cases.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702"
class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>Such was the general contrast which Sokratês sought to impress
upon his hearers by a variety of questions bearing on it, directly
or indirectly. One way of presenting it, which Plato devoted much
of his genius to expand in dialogue, was, to discuss, Whether
virtue be really teachable. How was it that superior men, like
Aristeidês and Periklês,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a> acquired the eminent qualities essential
for guiding and governing Athens, since they neither learned them
under any known master, as they had studied music and gymnastics,
nor could insure the same excellences to their sons, either through
their own agency or through that of any master? Was it not rather the
fact that virtue, as it was never expressly taught, so it was not
really teachable; but was vouchsafed or withheld according to the
special volition and grace of the gods? If a man has a young horse
to be broken, or trained, he finds without difficulty a professed
trainer, thoroughly conversant with the habits of the race,<a
id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> to
communicate to the animal the excellence required; but whom can he
find to teach virtue to his sons, with the like preliminary knowledge
and assured result? Nay, how can any one either teach virtue, or
affirm virtue to be teachable, unless he be prepared to explain what
virtue is, and what are the points of analogy and difference between
its various branches; justice, temperance, fortitude, prudence,
etc.? In several of the Platonic dialogues, the discussion turns on
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span> analysis of
these last-mentioned words: the “Lachês” and “Protagoras” on courage,
the “Charmidês” on temperance, the “Euthyphrôn” on holiness.</p>

<p>By these and similar discussions did Sokratês, and Plato
amplifying upon his master, raise indirectly all the important
questions respecting society, human aspirations and duties, and
the principal moral qualities which were accounted virtuous in
individual men. As the general terms, on which his conversation
turned, were among the most current and familiar in the language,
so also the abundant instances of detail, whereby he tested the
hearer’s rational comprehension and consistent application of
such large terms, were selected from the best known phenomena
of daily life;<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705"
class="fnanchor">[705]</a> bringing home the inconsistency, if
inconsistency there was, in a manner obvious to every one. The
answers made to him,—not merely by ordinary citizens, but by men of
talent and genius, such as the poets or the rhetors, when called
upon for an explanation of the moral terms and ideas set forth in
their own compositions,<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706"
class="fnanchor">[706]</a>—revealed alike that state of mind against
which his crusade, enjoined and consecrated by the Delphian oracle,
was directed, the semblance and conceit of knowledge without real
knowledge. They proclaimed confident, unhesitating persuasion, on
the greatest and gravest questions concerning man and society, in
the bosoms of persons who had never bestowed upon them sufficient
reflection to be aware that they involved any difficulty. Such
persuasion had grown up gradually and unconsciously, partly by
authoritative communication, partly by insensible transfusion, from
others; the process beginning antecedent to reason as a capacity,
continuing itself with little aid and no control from reason, and
never being finally revised. With the great terms and current
propositions concerning human life and society, a complex body of
association had become accumulated from countless particulars,
each separately trivial and lost to the memory, knit together by
a powerful sentiment, and imbibed as it were by each man from the
atmosphere of authority and example around<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span> him. Upon this basis the fancied
knowledge really rested; and reason, when invoked at all, was
called in simply as an handmaid, expositor, or apologist of the
preëxisting sentiment; as an accessory after the fact, not as a test
or verification. Every man found these persuasions in his own mind,
without knowing how they became established there; and witnessed them
in others, as portions of a general fund of unexamined common-place
and credence. Because the words were at once of large meaning,
embodied in old and familiar mental processes, and surrounded by a
strong body of sentiment, the general assertions in which they were
embodied appeared self-evident and imposing to every one: so that,
in spite of continual dispute in particular cases, no one thought
himself obliged to analyze the general propositions themselves, or to
reflect whether he had verified their import, and could apply them
rationally and consistently.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707"
class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon here adverted to is too obvious, even at the
present day, to need further elucidation as matter of fact. In
morals, in politics, in political economy, on all subjects relating
to man and society, the like confident persuasion of knowledge
without the reality is sufficiently prevalent: the like generation
and propagation, by authority and example, of unverified convictions,
resting upon strong sentiment, without consciousness of the steps
or conditions of their growth; the like enlistment of reason as
the one-sided advocate of a preëstablished sentiment; the like
illusion, because every man is familiar with the language, that
therefore every man is master of the complex facts, judgments,
and tendencies, involved in its signification, and competent both
to apply comprehensive words and to assume the truth or falsehood
of large propositions, without any special analysis or study.<a
id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span></p> <p>There
is one important difference, however, to note, between our time and
that of Sokratês. In his day, the impressions not only respecting
man and society, but also respecting the physical world, were of
this same self-sown, self-propagating, and unscientific character.
The popular astronomy of the Sokratic age was an aggregate of
primitive, superficial observations and imaginative inferences,
passing unexamined from elder men to younger, accepted with
unsuspecting faith, and consecrated by intense sentiment. Not only
men like Nikias, or Anytus and Melêtus, but even Sokratês himself,
protested against the impudence of Anaxagoras, when he degraded
the divine Helios and Selênê into a sun and moon of calculable
motions and magnitudes. But now, the development of the scientific
point of view, with the vast increase of methodized physical and
mathematical knowledge, has taught every one that such primitive
astronomical and physical convictions were nothing better than
“a fancy of knowledge without the reality.”<a id="FNanchor_709"
href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> Every one renounces
them without hesitation, seeks his conclusions from the scientific
teacher, and looks to the proofs alone for his guarantee. A man who
has never bestowed special study on astronomy, knows that he is
ignorant of it: to fancy that he knows it, without such preparation,
would be held an absurdity. While the scientific point of view has
thus acquired complete predominance in reference to the physical
world, it has made little way comparatively on topics regarding
man and society, wherein “fancy of knowledge without the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span> reality” continues to
reign, not without criticism and opposition, yet still as a paramount
force. And if a new Sokratês were now to put the same questions
in the market-place to men of all ranks and professions, he would
find the like confident persuasion and unsuspecting dogmatism as to
generalities; the like faltering, blindness, and contradiction, when
tested by cross-examining details.</p>

<p>In the time of Sokratês, this last comparison was not open;
since there did not exist, in any department, a body of doctrine
scientifically constituted: but the comparison which he actually
took, borrowed from the special trades and professions, brought
him to an important result. He was the first to see, and the idea
pervades all his speculations, that as in each art or profession
there is an end to be attained, a theory laying down the means and
conditions whereby it is attainable, and precepts deduced from that
theory, such precepts collectively taken directing and covering
nearly the entire field of practice, but each precept separately
taken liable to conflict with others, and therefore liable to
cases of exception; so all this is not less true, or admits not
less of being realized, respecting the general art of human living
and society. There is a grand and all-comprehensive End,—the
security and happiness, as far as practicable, of each and all
persons in the society:<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710"
class="fnanchor">[710]</a> there may be a theory, laying<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[p. 441]</span> down those means and
conditions under which the nearest approach can be made to that end:
there may also be precepts, prescribing to every man the conduct and
character which best enables him to become an auxiliary towards its
attainment, and imperatively restraining him from acts which tend
to hinder it; precepts deduced from the theory, each one of them
separately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[p. 442]</span> taken
being subject to exceptions, but all of them taken collectively
governing practice, as in each particular art.<a id="FNanchor_711"
href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> Sokratês and Plato
talk of “the art of dealing with human beings,” “the art of behaving
in society,” “that science which has for its object to make men
happy:” and they draw a marked distinction between art, or rules of
practice deduced from a theoretical survey of the subject-matter and
taught with precognition of the end, and mere artless, irrational
knack, or dexterity, acquired by simple copying, or assimilation,
through a process of which no one could render account.<a
id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Plato, with that variety of indirect allusion which is his
characteristic, continually constrains the reader to look upon
human and social life as having its own ends and purposes no
less than each separate profession or craft; and impels him to
transfer to the former that conscious analysis as a science, and
intelligent practice as an art, which are known as conditions of
success in the latter.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713"
class="fnanchor">[713]</a> It was in furtherance of these rational
conceptions, “Science and Art,” that Sokratês carried on his crusade
against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[p. 443]</span> “that
conceit of knowledge without reality,” which reigned undisturbed in
the moral world around him, and was only beginning to be slightly
disturbed even as to the physical world. To him the precept,
inscribed in the Delphian temple, “Know Thyself,” was the holiest
of all texts, which he constantly cited, and strenuously enforced
upon his hearers; interpreting it to mean, Know what sort of a man
thou art, and what are thy capacities, in reference to human use.<a
id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
His manner of enforcing it was alike original and effective, and
though he was dexterous in varying his topics<a id="FNanchor_715"
href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> and queries according
to the individual person with whom he had to deal, it was his first
object to bring the hearer to take just measure of his own real
knowledge or real ignorance. To preach, to exhort, even to confute
particular errors, appeared to Sokratês useless, so long as the mind
lay wrapped up in its habitual mist or illusion of wisdom: such mist
must be dissipated before any new light could enter. Accordingly, the
hearer being usually forward in announcing positive declarations on
those general doctrines, and explanations of those terms, to which he
was most attached and in which he had the most implicit confidence,
Sokratês took them to pieces, and showed that they involved
contradiction and inconsistency; professing himself to be without any
positive opinion, nor ever advancing any until the hearer’s mind had
undergone the proper purifying cross-examination.<a id="FNanchor_716"
href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span></p>

<p>It was this indirect and negative proceeding, which, though
only a part of the whole, stood out as his most original and most
conspicuous characteristic, and determined his reputation with a
large number of persons who took no trouble to know anything else
about him. It was an exposure no less painful than surprising to
the person questioned, and produced upon several of them an effect
of permanent alienation, so that they never came near him again,<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> but
reverted to their former state of mind without any permanent change.
But on the other hand, the ingenuity and novelty of the process was
highly interesting to hearers, especially youthful hearers, sons
of rich men, and enjoying leisure; who not only carried away with
them a lofty admiration of Sokratês, but were fond of trying to copy
his negative polemics.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718"
class="fnanchor">[718]</a> Probably men like Alkibiadês and Kritias
frequented his society chiefly for the purpose of acquiring a quality
which they might turn to some account in their political career.
His constant habit of never suffering a general term to remain
undetermined, but applying it at once to particulars; the homely
and effective instances of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p.
445]</span> which he made choice; the string of interrogatories each
advancing towards a result, yet a result not foreseen by any one;
the indirect and circuitous manner whereby the subject was turned
round, and at last approached and laid open by a totally different
face, all this constituted a sort of prerogative in Sokratês, which
no one else seems to have approached. Its effect was enhanced by a
voice and manner highly plausible and captivating, and to a certain
extent by the very eccentricity of his silenic physiognomy.<a
id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
What is termed “his irony,” or assumption of the character
of an ignorant learner, asking information from one who knew
better than himself, while it was essential<a id="FNanchor_720"
href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> as an excuse for his
practice as a questioner, contributed also to add zest and novelty
to his conversation; and totally banished from it both didactic
pedantry and seeming bias as an advocate; which, to one who talked
so much, was of no small advantage. After he had acquired celebrity,
this uniform profession of ignorance in debate was usually construed
as mere affectation; and those who merely heard him occasionally,
without penetrating into his intimacy, often suspected that he
was amusing himself with ingenious paradox.<a id="FNanchor_721"
href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> Timon the Satirist,
and Zeno the Epicurean, accordingly described him as a buffoon,
who turned every one into ridicule, especially men of eminence.<a
id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[p. 446]</span></p>

<p>It is by Plato that the negative and indirect vein of Sokratês has
been worked out and immortalized; while Xenophon, who sympathized
little in it, complains that others looked at his master too
exclusively on this side, and that they could not conceive him as
a guide to virtue, but only as a stirring and propulsive force.<a
id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
One of the principal objects of his “Memorabilia” is, to show
that Sokratês, after having worked upon novices sufficiently with
the negative line of questions, altered his tone, desisted from
embarrassing them, and addressed to them precepts not less plain
and simple than directly useful in practice.<a id="FNanchor_724"
href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> I do not at all doubt
that this was often the fact, and that the various dialogues in which
Xenophon presents to us the philosopher inculcating self-control,
temperance, piety, duty to parents, brotherly love, fidelity in
friendship, diligence, benevolence, etc., on positive grounds, are
a faithful picture of one valuable side of his character, and an
essential part of the whole. Such direct admonitory influence was
common to Sokratês with Prodikus and the best of the sophists.</p>

<p>It is, however, neither from the virtue of his life, nor from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> goodness
of his precepts—though both were essential features in his
character—that he derives his peculiar title to fame, but from
his originality and prolific efficacy in the line of speculative
philosophy. Of that originality, the first portion, as has been
just stated, consisted in his having been the first to conceive
the idea of an ethical science with its appropriate end, and with
precepts capable of being tested and improved; but the second
point, and not the least important, was, his peculiar method, and
extraordinary power of exciting scientific impulse and capacity in
the minds of others. It was not by positive teaching that this effect
was produced. Both Sokratês and Plato thought that little mental
improvement could be produced by expositions directly communicated,
or by new written matter lodged in the memory.<a id="FNanchor_725"
href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> It was necessary
that mind should work upon mind, by short question and answer, or
an expert employment of the dialectic process,<a id="FNanchor_726"
href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> in order to generate
new thoughts and powers; a process which Plato, with his exuberant
fancy, compares to copulation and pregnancy, representing it as the
true way, and the only effectual way, of propagating the philosophic
spirit.</p>

<p>We should greatly misunderstand the negative and indirect vein of
Sokratês, if we suppose that it ended in nothing more than simple
negation. On busy or ungifted minds, among the indiscriminate public
who heard him, it probably left little permanent effect of any kind,
and ended in a mere feeling of admiration for ingenuity, or perhaps
dislike of paradox: on practical minds like Xenophon, its effect was
merged in that of the preceptorial exhortation: but where the seed
fell upon an intellect having the least predisposition or capacity
for systematic thought, the negation had only the effect of driving
the hearer back at first, giving him a new impetus for afterwards
springing forward. The Sokratic dialectics, clearing away from the
mind its mist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span>
fancied knowledge, and laying bare the real ignorance, produced an
immediate effect like the touch of the torpedo:<a id="FNanchor_727"
href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> the newly-created
consciousness of ignorance was alike unexpected, painful, and
humiliating,—a season of doubt and discomfort; yet combined with an
internal working and yearning after truth, never before experienced.
Such intellectual quickening, which could never commence until the
mind had been disabused of its original illusion of false knowledge,
was considered by Sokratês not merely as the index and precursor, but
as the indispensable condition, of future progress. It was the middle
point in the ascending mental scale; the lowest point being ignorance
unconscious, self-satisfied, and mistaking itself for knowledge;
the next above, ignorance conscious, unmasked, ashamed of itself,
and thirsting after knowledge as yet unpossessed; while actual
knowledge, the third and highest stage, was only attainable after
passing through the second as a preliminary.<a id="FNanchor_728"
href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> This second, was a
sort of pregnancy; and every mind either by nature incapable of it,
or in which, from want of the necessary conjunction, it had never
arisen, was barren for all purposes of original or self-appropriated
thought. Sokratês regarded it as his peculiar vocation and skill,
employing another Platonic metaphor, while he had himself no power
of reproduction, to deal with such pregnant and troubled minds in
the capacity of a midwife; to assist them in that mental parturition
whereby they were to be relieved, but at the same time to scrutinize
narrowly the offspring which they brought forth; and if it should
prove distorted or unpromising, to cast it away with the rigor of a
Lykurgean nurse, whatever might be the reluctance of the mother-mind
to part with its new-born.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729"
class="fnanchor">[729]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[p.
449]</span> There is nothing which Plato is more fertile in
illustrating, than this relation between the teacher and the scholar,
operating not by what it put into the latter, but by what it evolved
out of him; by creating an uneasy longing after truth, aiding in the
elaboration necessary for obtaining relief, and testing whether the
doctrine elaborated possessed the real lineaments, or merely the
delusive semblance, of truth.</p>

<p>There are few things more remarkable than the description given of
the colloquial magic of Sokratês and its vehement effects, by those
who had themselves heard it and felt its force. Its suggestive and
stimulating power was a gift so extraordinary, as well to justify
any abundance of imagery on the part of Plato to illustrate it.<a
id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
On the subjects to which he applied himself, man and society, his
hearers had done little but feel and affirm:<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span> Sokratês undertook to make them
think, weigh, and examine themselves and their own judgments,
until the latter were brought into consistency with each other,
as well as with a known and venerable end. The generalizations
embodied in their judgments had grown together and coalesced in a
manner at once so intimate, so familiar, yet so unverified, that
the particulars implied in them had passed out of notice: so that
Sokratês, when he recalled these particulars out of a forgotten
experience, presented to the hearer his own opinions under a totally
new point of view. His conversations—even as they appear in the
reproduction of Xenophon, which presents but a mere skeleton of the
reality—exhibit the main features of a genuine inductive method,
struggling against the deep-lying, but unheeded, errors of the early
intellect acting by itself, without conscious march or scientific
guidance,—of the <i>intellectus sibi permissus</i>,—upon which Bacon so
emphatically dwells. Amidst abundance of <i>instantiæ negativæ</i>, the
scientific value of which is dwelt upon in the “Novum Organon,”<a
id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span> negative
instances, too, so dexterously chosen as generally to show the way
to new truth, in place of that error which they set aside,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[p. 452]</span>—there is a close
pressure on the hearer’s mind, to keep it in the distinct tract
of particulars, as conditions of every just and consistent
generalization; and to divert it from becoming enslaved to unexamined
formulæ, or from delivering mere intensity of persuasion under the
authoritative phrase of reason. Instead of anxiety to plant in the
hearer a conclusion ready-made and accepted on trust, the questioner
keeps up a prolonged suspense with special emphasis laid upon the
particulars tending both affirmatively and negatively; nor is his
purpose answered, until that state of knowledge and apprehended
evidence is created, out of which the conclusion starts as a living
product, with its own root and self-sustaining power consciously
linked with its premises. If this conclusion so generated be not the
same as that which the questioner himself adopts, it will at least
be some other, worthy of a competent and examining mind taking its
own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[p. 453]</span> independent
view of the appropriate evidence. And amidst all the variety and
divergence of particulars which we find enforced in the language
of Sokratês, the end, towards which all of them point, is one and
the same, emphatically signified, the good and happiness of social
man.</p>

<p>It is not, then, to multiply proselytes, or to procure
authoritative assent, but to create earnest seekers, analytical
intellects, foreknowing and consistent agents, capable of forming
conclusions for themselves and of teaching others, as well as to
force them into that path of inductive generalization whereby alone
trustworthy conclusions can be formed, that the Sokratic method
aspires. In many of the Platonic dialogues, wherein Sokratês is
brought forward as the principal disputant, we read a series of
discussions and arguments, distinct, though having reference to the
same subject, but terminating either in a result purely negative, or
without any definite result at all. The commentators often attempt,
but in my judgment with little success, either by arranging the
dialogues in a supposed sequence or by various other hypotheses, to
assign some positive doctrinal conclusion as having been indirectly
contemplated by the author. But if Plato had aimed at any substantive
demonstration of this sort, we cannot well imagine that he would have
left his purpose thus in the dark, visible only by the microscope
of a critic. The didactic value of these dialogues—that wherein the
genuine Sokratic spirit stands most manifest—consists, not in the
positive conclusion proved, but in the argumentative process itself,
coupled with the general importance of the subject, upon which
evidence negative and affirmative is brought to bear.</p>

<p>This connects itself with that which I remarked in the <a
href="#Zeno">preceding chapter</a>, when mentioning Zeno and the
first manifestations of dialectics, respecting the large sweep, the
many-sided argumentation, and the strength as well as forwardness
of the negative arm, in Grecian speculative philosophy. Through
Sokratês, this amplitude of dialectic range was transmitted from
Zeno, first to Plato and next to Aristotle. It was a proceeding
natural to men who were not merely interested in establishing, or
refuting some given particular conclusion, but who also—like expert
mathematicians in their own science—loved, esteemed, and sought
to improve the dialectic process itself, with the means of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span> verification which
it afforded; a feeling, of which abundant evidence is to be found
in the Platonic writings.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732"
class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Such pleasure in the scientific
operation,—though not merely innocent, but valuable both as
a stimulant and as a guarantee against error, and though the
corresponding taste among mathematicians is always treated with
the sympathy which it deserves,—incurs much unmerited reprobation
from modern historians of philosophy, under the name of love of
disputation, cavilling, or skeptical subtlety.</p>

<p>But over and above any love of the process, the subjects to which
dialectics were applied, from Sokratês downwards,—man and society,
ethics, politics, metaphysics, etc., were such as particularly called
for this many-sided handling. On topics like these, relating to
sequences of fact which depend upon a multitude of coöperating or
conflicting causes, it is impossible to arrive, by any one thread
of positive reasoning or induction, at absolute doctrine, which
a man may reckon upon finding always true, whether he remembers
the proof or not; as is the case with mathematical, astronomical,
or physical truth. The utmost which science can ascertain, on
subjects thus complicated, is an aggregate, not of peremptory
theorems and predictions, but of tendencies;<a id="FNanchor_733"
href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> by studying the
action of each separate cause, and combining them together as well as
our means admit. The knowledge of tendencies thus obtained, though
falling much short of certainty, is highly important for guidance:
but it is plain that conclusions of this nature, resulting from
multifarious threads of evidence, true only on a balance, and always
liable to limitation, can never be safely detached from the proofs
on which they rest, or taught as absolute and consecrated formulæ.<a
id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
They require to be kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[p.
455]</span> in perpetual and conscious association with the
evidences, affirmative and negative, by the joint consideration of
which their truth is established; nor can this object be attained
by any other means than by ever-renovated discussion, instituted
from new and distinct points of view, and with free play to that
negative arm which is indispensable as stimulus not less than as
control. To ask for nothing but results, to decline the labor of
verification, to be satisfied with a ready-made stock of established
positive arguments as proof, and to decry the doubter or negative
reasoner, who starts new difficulties, as a common enemy, this is
a proceeding sufficiently common, in ancient as well as in modern
times. But it is, nevertheless, an abnegation of the dignity, and
even of the functions, of speculative philosophy. It is the direct
reverse of the method both of Sokratês and Plato, who, as inquirers,
felt that, for the great subjects which they treated, multiplied
threads of reasoning, coupled with the constant presence of the
cross-examining elenchus, were indispensable. Nor is it less at
variance with the views of Aristotle,—though a man very different
from either of them,—who goes round his subject on all sides, states
and considers all its difficulties, and insists emphatically on the
necessity of having all these difficulties brought out in full force,
as the incitement and guide to positive philosophy, as well as the
test of its sufficiency.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735"
class="fnanchor">[735]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[p. 456]</span></p>

<p>Understanding thus the method of Sokratês, we shall be at no loss
to account for a certain variance on his part—and a still greater
variance on the part of Plato, who expanded the method in writing
so much more—with the sophists, without supposing the latter to be
corrupt teachers. As they aimed at qualifying young men for active
life, they accepted the current ethical and political sentiment, with
its unexamined commonplaces and inconsistencies, merely seeking to
shape it into what was accounted a meritorious character at Athens.
They were thus exposed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[p.
457]</span> along with others—and more than others, in consequence of
their reputation—to the analytical cross-examination of Sokratês, and
were quite as little able to defend themselves against it.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the success of Protagoras or any other
among these sophists, the mighty originality of Sokratês achieved
results not only equal at the time, but incomparably grander and more
lasting in reference to the future. Out of his intellectual school
sprang not merely Plato, himself a host, but all the other leaders
of Grecian speculation for the next half-century, and all those who
continued the great line of speculative philosophy down to later
times. Eukleidês and the Megaric school of philosophers,—Aristippus
and the Kyrenaic,—Antisthenês and Diogenês, the first of those
called the Cynics, all emanated more or less directly from the
stimulus imparted by Sokratês, though each followed a different
vein of thought.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736"
class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Ethics continue to be what Sokratês had
first made them, a distinct branch of philosophy, alongside of which
politics, rhetoric, logic, and other speculations relating to man and
society, gradually arranged themselves; all of them more popular, as
well as more keenly controverted, than physics, which at that time
presented comparatively little charm, and still less of attainable
certainty. There can be no doubt that the individual influence of
Sokratês permanently enlarged the horizon, improved the method, and
multiplied the ascendent minds, of the Grecian speculative world, in
a manner never since paralleled. Subsequent philosophers may have
had a more elaborate doctrine, and a larger number of disciples who
imbibed their ideas; but none of them applied the same stimulating
method with the same efficacy; none of them struck out of other minds
that fire which sets light to original thought; none of them either
produced in others the pains of intellectual pregnancy, or extracted
from others the fresh and unborrowed offspring of a really parturient
mind.</p>

<p>Having thus touched upon Sokratês, both as first opener
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[p. 458]</span> the field
of ethics to scientific study, and as author of a method, little
copied and never paralleled since his time, for stimulating in
other men’s minds earnest analytical inquiry, I speak last about
his theoretical doctrine. Considering the fanciful, far-fetched
ideas, upon which alone the Pythagoreans and other predecessors
had shaped their theories respecting virtues and vices, the wonder
is that Sokratês, who had no better guides to follow, should
have laid down an ethical doctrine which has the double merit of
being true, as far as it goes, legitimate, and of comprehensive
generality: though it errs, mainly by stating a part of the essential
conditions of virtue<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737"
class="fnanchor">[737]</a>—sometimes also a part of the ethical
end—as if it were the whole. Sokratês resolved all virtue into
knowledge or wisdom; all vice, into ignorance or folly. To do
right was the only way to impart happiness, or the least degree
of unhappiness compatible with any given situation: now this was
precisely what every one wished for and aimed at; only that many
persons, from ignorance, took the wrong road; and no man was wise
enough always to take the right. But as no man was willingly his
own enemy, so no man ever did wrong willingly; it was because
he was not fully or correctly informed of the consequences of
his own actions; so that the proper remedy to apply was enlarged
teaching of consequences and improved judgment.<a id="FNanchor_738"
href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> To make him willing
to be taught, the only condition required was to make him conscious
of his own ignorance; the want of which consciousness was the real
cause both of indocility and of vice.</p>

<p>That this doctrine sets forth one portion of the essential
condi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[p. 459]</span>tions of
virtue, is certain; and that too the most commanding portion, since
there can be no assured moral conduct except under the supremacy
of reason. But that it omits to notice, what is not less essential
to virtue, the proper condition of the emotions, desires, etc.,
taking account only of the intellect, is also certain; and has been
remarked by Aristotle<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739"
class="fnanchor">[739]</a> as well as by many others. It is
fruitless, in my judgment, to attempt by any refined explanation to
make out that Sokratês meant, by “knowledge,” something more than
what is directly implied in the word. He had present to his mind,
as the grand depravation of the human being, not so much vice, as
madness; that state in which a man does not know what he is doing.
Against the vicious man, securities both public and private may be
taken, with considerable effect; against the madman there is no
security except perpetual restraint. He is incapable of any of the
duties incumbent on social man, nor can he, even if he wishes, do
good either to himself or to others. The sentiment which we feel
towards such an unhappy being is, indeed, something totally different
from moral reprobation, such as we feel for the vicious man who does
wrong knowingly. But Sokratês took measure of both with reference
to the purposes of human life and society, and pronounced that the
latter was less completely spoiled for those purposes than the
former. Madness was ignorance at its extreme pitch, accompanied, too,
by the circumstance that the madman himself was unconscious of his
own ignorance, acting under a sincere persuasion that he knew what
he was doing. But short of this extremity, there were many varieties
and gradations in the scale of ignorance, which, if accompanied by
false conceit of knowledge, differed from madness only in degree, and
each of which disqualified a man from doing right, in proportion to
the ground which it covered. The worst of all ignorance—that which
stood nearest to madness—was when a man was ignorant of himself,
fancying that he knew what he did not really know, and that he
could do, or avoid, or endure, what was quite beyond his capacity;
when, for example, intending to speak the same truth, he sometimes
said one thing, sometimes another; or, casting up the same<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span> arithmetical figures,
made sometimes a greater sum, sometimes a less. A person who knows
his letters, or an arithmetician, may doubtless write bad orthography
or cast-up incorrectly, by design, but can also perform the
operations correctly, if he chooses; while one ignorant of writing
or of arithmetic, <i>cannot</i> do it correctly, even though he should be
anxious to do so. The former, therefore, comes nearer to the good
orthographer or arithmetician than the latter. So, if a man knows
what is just, honorable, and good, but commits acts of a contrary
character, he is juster, or comes nearer to being a just man, than
one who does not know what just acts are, and does not distinguish
them from unjust; for this latter <i>cannot</i> conduct himself
justly, even if he desires it ever so much.<a id="FNanchor_740"
href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>The opinion here maintained illustrates forcibly the general
doctrine of Sokratês. I have already observed that the fundamental
idea which governed his train of reasoning, was, the analogy of
each man’s social life and duty to a special profession or trade.
Now what is principally inquired after in regard to these special
men, is their professional capacity; without this, no person would
ever think of employing them, let their dispositions be ever so
good; with it, good dispositions and diligence are presumed, unless
there be positive grounds for suspecting the contrary. But why do
we indulge such presumption? Because their pecuniary interest,
their professional credit, and their place among competitors, are
staked upon success, so that we reckon upon their best efforts.
But in regard to that manifold and indefinite series of acts which
constitute the sum total of social duty, a man has no such special
interest to guide and impel him, nor can we presume in him those
dispositions which will insure his doing right, wherever he knows
what right is. Mankind are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p.
461]</span> obliged to give premiums for these dispositions, and to
attach penalties to the contrary, by means of praise and censure;
moreover, the natural sympathies and antipathies of ordinary minds,
which determine so powerfully the application of moral terms, run
spontaneously in this direction, and even overshoot the limit which
reason would prescribe. The analogy between the paid special duty and
the general social duty, fails in this particular. Even if Sokratês
were correct as to the former,—and this would be noway true,—in
making the intellectual conditions of good conduct stand for the
whole, no such inference could safely be extended to the latter.</p>

<p>Sokratês affirmed that “well-doing” was the noblest pursuit of
man. “Well-doing” consisted in doing a thing well after having
learned it and practised it, by the rational and proper means; it was
altogether disparate from good fortune, or success without rational
scheme and preparation. “The best man (he said), and the most beloved
by the gods, is he who, as an husbandman, performs well the duties
of husbandry; as a surgeon, those of medical art; in political life,
his duty towards the commonwealth. But the man who does nothing well,
is neither useful, nor agreeable to the gods.”<a id="FNanchor_741"
href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> This is the Sokratic
view of human life; to look at it as an assemblage of realities
and practical details; to translate the large words of the moral
vocabulary into those homely particulars to which at bottom they
refer; to take account of acts, not of dispositions apart from act
(in contradiction to the ordinary flow of the moral sympathies); to
enforce upon every one, that what he chiefly required was teaching
and practice, as preparations for act; and that therefore ignorance,
especially ignorance mistaking itself for knowledge, was his capital
deficiency. The religion of Sokratês, as well as his ethics, had
reference to practical human ends; nor had any man ever less of that
transcendentalism in his mind, which his scholar Plato exhibits in
such abundance.</p>

<p>It is indisputable, then, that Sokratês laid down a general
ethical theory which is too narrow, and which states a part of
the truth as if it were the whole. But, as it frequently happens
with philosophers who make the like mistake, we find that he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> did not confine
his deductive reasonings within the limits of the theory, but
escaped the erroneous consequences by a partial inconsistency. For
example; no man ever insisted more emphatically than he, on the
necessity of control over the passions and appetites, of enforcing
good habits, and on the value of that state of the sentiments and
emotions which such a course tended to form.<a id="FNanchor_742"
href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> In truth, this is
one particular characteristic of his admonitions. He exhorted men
to limit their external wants, to be sparing in indulgence, and
to cultivate, even in preference to honors and advancement, those
pleasures which would surely arise from a performance of duty, as
well as from self-examination and the consciousness of internal
improvement. This earnest attention, in measuring the elements and
conditions of happiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[p.
463]</span> to the state of the internal associations as contrasted
with the effect of external causes, as well as the pains taken
to make it appear how much the latter depend upon the former for
their power of conferring happiness, and how sufficient is moderate
good fortune in respect to externals, provided the internal man
be properly disciplined, is a vein of thought which pervades both
Sokratês and Plato, and which passed from them, under various
modifications, to most of the subsequent schools of ethical
philosophy. It is probable that Protagoras or Prodikus, training rich
youth for active life, without altogether leaving out such internal
element of happiness, would yet dwell upon it less; a point of
decided superiority in Sokratês.</p>

<p>The political opinions of Sokratês were much akin to his ethical,
and deserve especial notice, as having in part contributed to his
condemnation by the dikastery. He thought that the functions of
government belonged legitimately to those who knew best how to
exercise them for the advantage of the governed. “The legitimate king
or governor was not the man who held the sceptre, nor the man elected
by some vulgar persons, nor he who had got the post by lot, nor he
who had thrust himself in by force or by fraud, but he alone who
knew how to govern well.”<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743"
class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Just as the pilot governed on shipboard,
the surgeon in a sick man’s house, the trainer in a palæstra;
every one else being eager to obey these professional superiors,
and even thanking and recompensing them for their directions,
simply because their greater knowledge was an admitted fact. It was
absurd, Sokratês used to contend, to choose public officers by lot,
when no one would trust himself on shipboard under the care of a
pilot selected by hazard,<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744"
class="fnanchor">[744]</a> nor would any one pick out a carpenter or
a musician in like manner.</p>

<p>We do not know what provision Sokratês suggested for applying his
principle to practice, for discovering who was the fittest man in
point of knowledge, or for superseding him in case of his becoming
unfit, or in case another fitter than he should arise. The analogies
of the pilot, the surgeon, and professional men generally, would
naturally conduct him to election by the people, renewable after
temporary periods; since no one of these profes<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_464">[p. 464]</span>sional persons, whatever may be his
positive knowledge, is ever trusted or obeyed except by the free
choice of those who confide in him, and who may at any time make
choice of another. But it does not appear that Sokratês followed out
this part of the analogy. His companions remarked to him that his
first-rate intellectual ruler would be a despot, who might, if he
pleased, either refuse to listen to good advice, or even put to death
those who gave it. “He will not act thus,” replied Sokratês, “for if
he does, he will himself be the greatest loser.”<a id="FNanchor_745"
href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>We may notice in this doctrine of Sokratês the same imperfection
as that which is involved in the ethical doctrine; a disposition
to make the intellectual conditions of political fitness stand for
the whole. His negative political doctrine is not to be mistaken:
he approved neither of democracy, nor of oligarchy. As he was not
attached, either by sentiment or by conviction, to the constitution
of Athens, so neither had he the least sympathy with oligarchical
usurpers, such as the Four Hundred and the Thirty. His positive ideal
state, as far as we can divine it, would have been something like
that which is worked out in the “Cyropædia” of Xenophon.</p>

<p>In describing the persevering activity of Sokratês, as a religious
and intellectual missionary, we have really described his life; for
he had no other occupation than this continual intercourse with the
Athenian public; his indiscriminate conversation, and invincible
dialectics. Discharging faithfully and bravely his duties as an
hoplite on military service,—but keeping aloof from official duty in
the dikastery, the public assembly, or the senate-house, except in
that one memorable year of the battle of Arginusæ,—he incurred none
of those party animosities which an active public life at Athens
often provoked. His life was legally blameless, nor had he ever been
brought up before the dikastery until his one final trial, when
he was seventy years of age. That he stood conspicuous before the
public eye in 423 <small>B.C.</small>, at the time when
the “Clouds” of Aristophanês were brought on the stage, is certain:
he may have been, and probably was, conspicuous even earlier: so
that we can hardly allow him less than thirty years of public,
notorious, and efficacious discoursing, down to his trial in 399
<small>B.C.</small></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span></p>

<p>It was in that year that Melêtus, seconded by two auxiliaries,
Anytus and Lykon, presented against him, and hung up in the appointed
place, the portico before the office of the second or king-archon, an
indictment against him in the following terms: “Sokratês is guilty of
crime: first, for not worshipping the gods whom the city worships,
but introducing new divinities of his own; next, for corrupting the
youth. The penalty due is—death.”</p>

<p>It is certain that neither the conduct nor the conversation of
Sokratês had undergone any alteration for many years past; since the
sameness of his manner of talking is both derided by his enemies
and confessed by himself. Our first sentiment, therefore, apart
from the question of guilt or innocence, is one of astonishment,
that he should have been prosecuted, at seventy years of age, for
persevering in an occupation which he had publicly followed during
twenty-five or thirty years preceding. Xenophon, full of reverence
for his master, takes up the matter on much higher ground, and
expresses himself in a feeling of indignant amazement that the
Athenians could find anything to condemn in a man every way so
admirable. But whoever attentively considers the picture which
I have presented of the purpose, the working, and the extreme
publicity of Sokratês, will rather be inclined to wonder, not
that the indictment was presented at last, but that some such
indictment had not been presented long before. Such certainly is the
impression suggested by the language of Sokratês himself, in the
“Platonic Apology.” He there proclaims, emphatically, that though
his present accusers were men of consideration, it was neither
<i>their</i> enmity, nor <i>their</i> eloquence, which he had now principally
to fear; but the accumulated force of antipathy,—the numerous and
important personal enemies, each with sympathizing partisans,—the
long-standing and uncontradicted calumnies,<a id="FNanchor_746"
href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> raised against him
throughout his cross-examining career.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span></p> <p>In truth, the mission of
Sokratês, as he himself describes it, could not but prove eminently
unpopular and obnoxious. To convince a man that, of matters which he
felt confident of knowing, and had never thought of questioning or
even of studying, he is really profoundly ignorant, insomuch that he
cannot reply to a few pertinent queries without involving himself
in flagrant contradictions, is an operation highly salutary, often
necessary, to his future improvement; but an operation of painful
surgery, in which, indeed, the temporary pain experienced is one of
the conditions almost indispensable to the future beneficial results.
It is one which few men can endure without hating the operator at the
time; although doubtless such hatred would not only disappear, but
be exchanged for esteem and admiration, if they persevered until the
full ulterior consequences of the operation developed themselves.
But we know, from the express statement of Xenophon, that many, who
underwent this first pungent thrust of his dialectics, never came
near him again: he disregarded them as laggards,<a id="FNanchor_747"
href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> but their voices did
not the less count in the hostile chorus. What made that chorus the
more formidable, was the high quality and position of its leaders.
For Sokratês himself tells us, that the men whom he chiefly and
expressly sought out to cross-examine, were the men of celebrity as
statesmen, rhetors, poets, or artisans; those at once most sensitive
to such humiliation, and most capable of making their enmity
effective.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon this great body of antipathy, so terrible
both from number and from constituent items, we shall wonder only
that Sokratês could have gone on so long standing in the market-place
to aggravate it, and that the indictment of Melêtus could have
been so long postponed; since it was just as applicable earlier
as later, and since the sensitive temper of the people, as to
charges of irreligion, was a well-known fact.<a id="FNanchor_748"
href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> The truth is, that
as history presents to us only one man who ever devoted his life to
prosecute this duty of an elenchic, or cross-examining missionary, so
there was but one city, in the ancient world at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_467">[p. 467]</span> least, wherein he would have been
allowed to prosecute it for twenty-five years with safety and
impunity; and that city was Athens. I have in a previous volume noted
the respect for individual dissent of opinion, taste, and behavior,
among one another, which characterized the Athenian population, and
which Periklês puts in emphatic relief as a part of his funeral
discourse. It was this established liberality of the democratical
sentiment at Athens which so long protected the noble eccentricity
of Sokratês from being disturbed by the numerous enemies which he
provoked: at Sparta, at Thebes, at Argos, Milêtus, or Syracuse,
his blameless life would have been insufficient as a shield, and
his irresistible dialectic power would have caused him to be only
the more speedily silenced. Intolerance is the natural weed of the
human bosom, though its growth or development may be counteracted
by liberalizing causes; of these, at Athens, the most powerful was,
the democratical constitution as there worked, in combination with
diffused intellectual and æsthetical sensibility, and keen relish
for discourse. Liberty of speech was consecrated, in every man’s
estimation, among the first of privileges; every man was accustomed
to hear opinions, opposite to his own, constantly expressed, and to
believe that others had a right to their opinions as well as himself.
And though men would not, as a general principle, have extended
such toleration to religious subjects, yet the established habit
in reference to other matters greatly influenced their practice,
and rendered them more averse to any positive severity against
avowed dissenters from the received religious belief. It is certain
that there was at Athens both a keener intellectual stimulus, and
greater freedom as well of thought as of speech, than in any other
city of Greece. The long toleration of Sokratês is one example of
this general fact, while his trial proves little, and his execution
nothing, against it, as will presently appear.</p>

<p>There must doubtless have been particular circumstances, of which
we are scarcely at all informed, which induced his accusers to prefer
their indictment at the actual moment, in spite of the advanced age
of Sokratês.</p>

<p>In the first place, Anytus, one of the accusers of Sokratês,
appears to have become incensed against him on private grounds. The
son of Anytus had manifested interest in his conversation,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[p. 468]</span> and Sokratês,
observing in the young man intellectual impulse and promise,
endeavored to dissuade his father from bringing him up to his own
trade of a leather-seller.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749"
class="fnanchor">[749]</a> It was in this general way that a
great proportion of the antipathy against Sokratês was excited,
as he himself tells us in the “Platonic Apology.” The young men
were those to whom he chiefly addressed himself, and who, keenly
relishing his conversation, often carried home new ideas which
displeased their fathers;<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750"
class="fnanchor">[750]</a> hence the general charge against Sokratês,
of corrupting the youth. Now this circumstance had recently happened
in the peculiar case of Anytus, a rich tradesman, a leading man in
politics, and just now of peculiar influence in the city, because he
had been one of the leading fellow-laborers with Thrasybulus in the
expulsion of the Thirty, manifesting an energetic and meritorious
patriotism. He, like Thrasybulus and many others, had sustained
great loss of property<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a> during the oligarchical dominion;
which perhaps made him the more strenuous in requiring that his
son should pursue trade with assiduity, in order to restore the
family fortunes. He seems, moreover, to have been an enemy of all
teaching which went beyond the narrowest practicality, hating alike
Sokratês and the sophists.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752"
class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>While we can thus point out a recent occurrence, which had brought
one of the most ascendent politicians in the city into special
exasperation against Sokratês, another circumstance which weighed
him down was, his past connection with the deceased Kritias and
Alkibiadês. Of these two men, the latter, though he had some great
admirers, was on the whole odious; still more from his private
insolence and enormities than from his public treason as an exile.
But the name of Kritias was detested, and deservedly detested,
beyond that of any other man in Athenian history, as the chief
director of the unmeasured spoliation and atrocities committed by
the Thirty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[p. 469]</span> That
Sokratês had educated both Kritias and Alkibiadês, was affirmed by
the accusers, and seemingly believed by the general public, both at
the time and afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753"
class="fnanchor">[753]</a> That both of them had been among those who
conversed with him, when young men, is an unquestionable fact; to
what extent, or down to what period, the conversation was carried,
we cannot distinctly ascertain. Xenophon affirms that both of them
frequented his society when young, to catch from him an argumentative
facility which might be serviceable to their political ambition;
that he curbed their violent and licentious propensities, so long
as they continued to come to him; that both of them manifested a
respectful obedience to him, which seemed in little consonance
with their natural tempers; but that they soon quitted him, weary
of such restraint, after having acquired as much as they thought
convenient of his peculiar accomplishment. The writings of Plato,
on the contrary, impress us with the idea that the association
of both of them with Sokratês must have been more continued and
intimate; for both of them are made to take great part in the
Platonic dialogues, while the attachment of Sokratês to Alkibiadês
is represented as stronger than that which he ever felt towards
any other man; a fact not difficult to explain, since the latter,
notwithstanding his ungovernable dispositions, was distinguished in
his youth not less for capacity and forward impulse, than for beauty;
and since youthful beauty fired the imagination of the Greeks,
especially that of Sokratês, more than the charms of the other sex.<a
id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a>
From the year 420 <small>B.C.</small>, in which the
activity of Alkibiadês as a political leader commenced, it seems
unlikely that he could have seen much of Sokratês, and after the
year 415 <small>B.C.</small> the fact is impossible;
since in that year he became a permanent exile, with the exception of
three or four months in the year 407 <small>B.C.</small>
At the moment of the trial of Sokratês, therefore, his connection
with Alkibiadês must at least have been a fact long past and gone.
Respecting Kritias, we make out less; and as he was a kinsman<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[p. 470]</span> of Plato, one of the
well-known companions of Sokratês, and present at his trial, and
himself an accomplished and literary man, his association with
Sokratês may have continued longer; at least a color was given for
so asserting. Though the supposition that any of the vices either
of Kritias or Alkibiadês were encouraged, or even tolerated, by
Sokratês, can have arisen in none but prejudiced or ill-informed
minds, yet it is certain that such a supposition was entertained; and
that it placed him before the public in an altered position after
the enormities of the Thirty. Anytus, incensed with him already on
the subject of his son, would be doubly incensed against him as the
reputed tutor of Kritias.</p>

<p>Of Melêtus, the primary, though not the most important accuser, we
know only that he was a poet; of Lykon, that he was a rhetor. Both
these classes had been alienated by the cross-examining dialectics
to which many of their number had been exposed by Sokratês. They
were the last men to bear such an exposure with patience, and their
enmity, taken as a class rarely unanimous, was truly formidable when
it bore upon any single individual.</p>

<p>We know nothing of the speeches of either of the accusers before
the dikastery, except what can be picked out from the remarks in
Xenophon and the defence of Plato. Of the three counts of the
indictment, the second was the easiest for them to support, on
plausible grounds. That Sokratês was a religious innovator, would
be considered as proved by the peculiar divine sign, of which he
was wont to speak freely and publicly, and which visited no one
except himself. Accordingly, in the “Platonic Defence,” he never
really replies to this second charge. He questions Melêtus before
the dikastery, and the latter is represented as answering, that he
meant to accuse Sokratês of not believing in the gods at all;<a
id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> to
which imputed disbelief Sokratês answers with an emphatic negative.
In support of the first count, however,—the charge of general
disbelief in the gods recognized by the city,—nothing in his conduct
could be cited; for he was exact in his legal worship like other
citizens, and even more than others, if Xenophon is correct.<a
id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a>
But it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[p. 471]</span>
appear that the old calumnies of the Aristophanic “Clouds” were
revived, and that the effect of that witty drama, together with
similar efforts of Eupolis and others, perhaps hardly less witty,
was still enduring; a striking proof that these comedians were no
impotent libellers. Sokratês manifests greater apprehension of the
effect of the ancient impressions, than of the speeches which had
been just delivered against him: but these latter speeches would of
course tell, by refreshing the sentiments of the past, and reviving
the Aristophanic picture of Sokratês, as a speculator on physics
as well as a rhetorical teacher for pleading, making the worse
appear the better reason.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757"
class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Sokratês, in the “Platonic Defence,”
appeals to the number of persons who had heard him discourse,
whether any of them had ever heard him say one word on the subject
of physical studies;<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758"
class="fnanchor">[758]</a> while Xenophon goes further, and
represents him as having positively discountenanced them, on
the ground of impiety.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759"
class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>As there were three distinct accusers to speak against Sokratês,
so we may reasonably suppose that they would concert beforehand
on what topics each should insist; Melêtus undertaking that which
related to religion, while Anytus and Lykon would dwell on the
political grounds of attack. In the “Platonic Apology,” Sokratês
comments emphatically on the allegations of Melêtus, questions
him publicly before the dikasts, and criticizes his replies: he
makes little allusion to Anytus, or to anything except what is
formally embodied in the indictment; and treats the last count,
the charge of corrupting youth, in connection with the first, as
if the corruption alleged consisted in irreligious teaching. But
Xenophon intimates that the accusers, in enforcing this allegation of
pernicious teaching, went into other matters quite distinct from the
religious tenets of Sokratês, and denounced him as having taught them
lawlessness and disrespect, as well towards their parents as towards
their country. We find mention made in Xenophon of accusatory grounds
similar to those in the “Clouds;” similar also to those which modern
authors usually advance against the sophists.</p>

<p>Sokratês, said Anytus and the other accusers, taught young<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[p. 472]</span> men to despise the
existing political constitution, by remarking that the Athenian
practice of naming archons by lot was silly, and that no man of
sense would ever choose in this way a pilot or a carpenter, though
the mischief arising from bad qualification, was in these cases
far less than in the case of the archons.<a id="FNanchor_760"
href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Such teaching, it
was urged, destroyed in the minds of the hearers respect for the
laws and constitution, and rendered them violent and licentious. As
examples of the way in which it had worked, his two pupils Kritias
and Alkibiadês might be cited, both formed in his school; one, the
most violent and rapacious of the Thirty recent oligarchs; the
other, a disgrace to the democracy, by his outrageous insolence
and licentiousness;<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761"
class="fnanchor">[761]</a> both of them authors of ruinous mischief
to the city.</p>

<p>Moreover, the youth learned from him conceit of their own superior
wisdom, and the habit of insulting their fathers as well as of
slighting their other kinsmen. Sokratês told them, it was urged,
that even their fathers, in case of madness, might be lawfully put
under restraint; and that when a man needed service, those whom he
had to look to, were not his kinsmen, as such, but the persons best
qualified to render it: thus, if he was sick, he must consult a
surgeon; if involved in a lawsuit, those who were most conversant
with such a situation. Between friends also, mere good feeling and
affection was of little use; the important circumstance was, that
they should acquire the capacity of rendering mutual service to each
other. No one was worthy of esteem except the man who knew what was
proper to be done, and could explain it to others: which meant, urged
the accuser, that Sokratês was not only the wisest of men, but the
only person capable of making his pupils wise; other advisers being
worthless compared with him.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762"
class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>He was in the habit too, the accusation proceeded, of citing
the worst passages out of distinguished poets, and of perverting
them to the mischievous purpose of spoiling the dispositions of
youth, planting in them criminal and despotic tendencies. Thus he
quoted a line of Hesiod: “No work is disgraceful; but indolence
is disgraceful:” explaining it to mean, that a man might<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[p. 473]</span> without scruple do
any sort of work, base or unjust as it might be, for the sake of
profit. Next, Sokratês was particularly fond of quoting those lines
of Homer, in the second book of the Iliad, wherein Odysseus is
described as bringing back the Greeks, who had just dispersed from
the public agora in compliance with the exhortation of Agamemnôn,
and were hastening to their ships. Odysseus caresses and flatters
the chiefs, while he chides and even strikes the common men; though
both were doing the same thing, and guilty of the same fault; if
fault it was, to obey what the commander-in-chief had himself
just suggested. Sokratês interpreted this passage, the accuser
affirmed, as if Homer praised the application of stripes to poor
men and the common people.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763"
class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p>Nothing could be easier than for an accuser to find matter for
inculpation of Sokratês, by partial citations from his continual
discourses, given without the context or explanations which had
accompanied them; by bold invention, where even this partial basis
was wanting; sometimes also by taking up real error, since no man
who is continually talking, especially extempore, can always talk
correctly. Few teachers would escape, if penal sentences were
permitted to tell against them, founded upon evidence such as this.
Xenophon, in noticing the imputations, comments upon them all,
denies some, and explains others. As to the passages out of Hesiod
and Homer, he affirms that Sokratês drew from them inferences quite
contrary to those alleged;<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764"
class="fnanchor">[764]</a> which latter seem, indeed, altogether
unreasonable, invented to call forth the deep-seated democratical
sentiment of the Athenians, after the accuser had laid his
preliminary ground by connecting Sokratês with Kritias and
Alkibiadês. That Sokratês improperly depreciated either filial duty
or the domestic affections, is in like manner highly improbable.
We may much more reasonably believe the assertion of Xenophon, who
represents him to have exhorted the hearer “to make himself as wise,
and as capable of rendering service, as possible; so that, when he
wished to acquire esteem from father or brother or friend, he might
not sit still, in reliance on the simple fact of relationship,
but might earn such feeling by doing them positive good.”<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> To
tell a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[p. 474]</span> man
that mere good feeling would be totally insufficient, unless he were
prepared and competent to carry it into action, is a lesson which
few parents would wish to discourage. Nor would any generous parent
make it a crime against the teaching of Sokratês, that it rendered
his son wiser than himself, which probably it would do. To restrict
the range of teaching for a young man, because it may make him think
himself wiser than his father, is only one of the thousand shapes in
which the pleading of ignorance against knowledge was then, and still
continues occasionally to be, presented.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not to be denied that these attacks of
Anytus bear upon the vulnerable side of the Sokratic general theory
of ethics, according to which virtue was asserted to depend upon
knowledge. I have already remarked that this is true, but not the
whole truth; a certain state of the affections and dispositions being
not less indispensable, as conditions of virtue, than a certain state
of the intelligence. An enemy, therefore, had some pretence for
making it appear that Sokratês, stating a part of the truth as the
whole, denied or degraded all that remained. But though this would
be a criticism not entirely unfounded against his general theory,
it would not hold against his precepts or practical teaching, as we
find them in Xenophon; for these, as I have remarked, reach much
wider than his general theory, and inculcate the cultivation of
habits and dispositions not less strenuously than the acquisition of
knowledge.</p>

<p>The censures affirmed to have been cast by Sokratês against the
choice of archons by lot at Athens, are not denied by Xenophon. The
accuser urged that “by such censures Sokratês excited the young men
to despise the established constitution, and to become lawless and
violent in their conduct.”<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766"
class="fnanchor">[766]</a> This is just the same pretence, of
tendency to bring the government into hatred and contempt, on which
in former days prosecutions for public libel were instituted against
writers in England, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[p.
475]</span> on which they still continue to be abundantly instituted
in France, under the first President of the Republic. There can
hardly be a more serious political mischief than such confusion
of the disapproving critic with a conspirator, and imposition of
silence upon dissentient minorities. Nor has there ever been any
case in which such an imputation was more destitute of color than
that of Sokratês, who appealed always to men’s reason and very
little to their feelings; so little, indeed, that modern authors
make his coldness a matter of charge against him; who never omitted
to inculcate rigid observance of the law, and set the example of
such observance himself. Whatever may have been his sentiments about
democracy, he always obeyed the democratical government, nor is there
any pretence for charging him with participation in oligarchical
schemes. It was the Thirty who, for the first time in his long life,
interdicted his teaching altogether, and were on the point almost of
taking his life; while his intimate friend Chærephon was actually in
exile with the democrats.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767"
class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>Xenophon lays great emphasis on two points, when defending
Sokratês against his accusers. First, that his own conduct was
virtuous, self-denying, and strict in obedience to the law. Next,
that he accustomed his hearers to hear nothing except appeals to
their reason, and impressed on them obedience only to their rational
convictions. That such a man, with so great a weight of presumption
in his favor, should be tried and found guilty as a corruptor of
youth,—the most undefined of all imaginable charges,—is a grave and
melancholy fact in the history of mankind. Yet when we see upon what
light evidence modern authors are willing to admit the same charge
against the sophists, we have no right to wonder that the Athenians
when addressed, not through that calm reason to which Sokratês
appealed, but through all their antipathies, religious as well as
political, public as well as private—were exasperated into dealing
with him as the type and precursor of Kritias and Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>After all, the exasperation, and the consequent verdict of guilty,
were not wholly the fault of the dikasts, nor wholly brought about
by his accusers and his numerous private enemies. No such verdict
would have been given, unless by what we must<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_476">[p. 476]</span> call the consent and concurrence of
Sokratês himself. This is one of the most important facts of the
case, in reference both to himself and to the Athenians.</p>

<p>We learn from his own statement in the “Platonic Defence,” that
the verdict of guilty was only pronounced by a majority of five or
six, amidst a body so numerous as an Athenian dikastery; probably
five hundred and fifty-seven in total number,<a id="FNanchor_768"
href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> if a confused
statement in Diogenes Laërtius can be trusted. Now any one who
reads that defence, and considers it in conjunction with the
circumstances of the case and the feelings of the dikasts, will see
that its tenor is such as must have turned a much greater number
of votes than six against him. And we are informed by the distinct
testimony of Xenophon,<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769"
class="fnanchor">[769]</a> that Sokratês approached his trial
with the feelings of one who hardly wished to be acquitted. He
took no thought whatever for the preparation of his defence; and
when his friend Hermogenês remonstrated with him on the serious
consequences of such an omission, he replied, first, that the just
and blameless life, which he was conscious of having passed, was
the best of all preparations for defence; next, that having once
begun to meditate on what it would be proper for him to say, the
divine sign had interposed to forbid him from proceeding. He went on
to say, that it was no wonder that the gods should deem it better
for him to die now, than to live longer. He had hitherto lived in
perfect satisfaction, with a consciousness of progressive moral
improvement, and with esteem, marked and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_477">[p. 477]</span> unabated, from his friends. If his
life were prolonged, old age would soon overpower him; he would
lose in part his sight, his hearing, or his intelligence; and life
with such abated efficacy and dignity would be intolerable to him.
Whereas, if he were condemned now, he should be condemned unjustly,
which would be a great disgrace to his judges, but none to him; nay,
it would even procure for him increase of sympathy and admiration,
and a more willing acknowledgment from every one that he had been
both a just man and an improving preceptor.<a id="FNanchor_770"
href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>These words, spoken before his trial, intimate a state of
belief which explains the tenor of the defence, and formed one
essential condition of the final result. They prove that Sokratês
not only cared little for being acquitted, but even thought that
the approaching trial was marked out by the gods as the term of
his life, and that there were good reasons why he should prefer
such a consummation as best for himself. Nor is it wonderful that
he should entertain that opinion, when we recollect the entire
ascendency within him of strong internal conscience and intelligent
reflection, built upon an originally fearless temperament, and
silencing what Plato<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771"
class="fnanchor">[771]</a> calls “the child within us, who trembles
before death;” his great love of colloquial influence, and incapacity
of living without it; his old age, now seventy years, rendering it
impossible that such influence could much longer continue, and the
opportunity afforded to him, by now towering above ordinary men under
the like circumstances, to read an impressive lesson, as well as to
leave behind him a reputation yet more exalted than that which he had
hitherto acquired. It was in this frame of mind that Sokratês came to
his trial, and undertook his unpremeditated defence, the substance
of which we now read in the “Platonic Apology.” His calculations,
alike high-minded and well-balanced, were completely realized. Had
he been acquitted after such a defence, it would have been not only
a triumph over his personal enemies, but would have been a sanction
on the part of the people and the popular dikastery to his teaching,
which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[p. 478]</span> indeed,
had been enforced by Anytus,<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772"
class="fnanchor">[772]</a> in his accusing argument, in reference to
acquittal generally, even before he heard the defence: whereas his
condemnation, and the feelings with which he met it, have shed double
and triple lustre over his whole life and character.</p>

<p>Prefaced by this exposition of the feelings of Sokratês, the
“Platonic Defence” becomes not merely sublime and impressive, but
also the manifestation of a rational and consistent purpose. It
does, indeed, include a vindication of himself against two out
of the three counts of the indictment; against the charge of not
believing in the recognized gods of Athens, and that of corrupting
the youth; respecting the second of the three, whereby he was
charged with religious innovation, he says little or nothing.
But it bears no resemblance to the speech of one standing on his
trial, with the written indictment concluding “Penalty, Death,”
hanging up in open court before him. On the contrary, it is an
emphatic lesson to the hearers, embodied in the frank outpouring of
a fearless and self-confiding conscience. It is undertaken, from
the beginning, because the law commands; with a faint wish, and
even not an unqualified wish, but no hope, that it may succeed.<a
id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
Sokratês first replies to the standing antipathies against him
without, arising from the number of enemies whom his cross-examining
elenchus had aroused against him, and from those false reports which
the Aristophanic “Clouds” had contributed so much to circulate. In
accounting for the rise of these antipathies, he impresses upon the
dikasts the divine mission under which he was acting, not without
considerable doubts whether they will believe him to be in earnest;<a
id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
and gives that interesting exposition of his intellectual campaign,
against “the conceit of knowledge without the reality,” of which I
have already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[p. 479]</span>
spoken. He then goes into the indictment, questions Melêtus in
open court, and dissects his answers. Having rebutted the charge
of irreligion, he reverts again to the imperative mandate of the
gods under which he is acting, “to spend his life in the search for
wisdom, and in examining himself as well as others;” a mandate,
which if he were to disobey, he would be then justly amenable to
the charge of irreligion;<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775"
class="fnanchor">[775]</a> and he announces to the dikasts
distinctly, that, even if they were now to acquit him, he neither
could nor would relax in the course which he had been pursuing.<a
id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
He considers that the mission imposed upon him is among the
greatest blessings ever conferred by the gods upon Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>
He deprecates those murmurs of surprise or displeasure, which his
discourse evidently called forth more than once,<a id="FNanchor_778"
href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> though not so much
on his own account as on that of the dikasts, who will be benefited
by hearing him, and who will hurt themselves and their city much
more than him, if they should now pronounce condemnation.<a
id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>
It was not on his own account that he sought to defend himself,
but on account of the Athenians, lest they by condemning him
should sin against the gracious blessing of the god; they would
not easily find such another, if they should put him to death.<a
id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Though his mission had spurred him on to indefatigable activity
in individual colloquy, yet the divine sign had always forbidden
him from taking active part in public proceedings; on the two
exceptional occasions when he had stood publicly forward,—once
under the democracy, once under the oligarchy,—he had shown the
same resolution as at present; not to be deterred by any terrors
from that course which he believed to be just.<a id="FNanchor_781"
href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Young men were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[p. 480]</span> delighted as well as
improved by listening to his cross-examinations; in proof of the
charge that he had corrupted them, no evidence had been produced;
neither any of themselves, who, having been once young when they
enjoyed his conversation, had since grown elderly; nor any of their
relatives; while he on his part could produce abundant testimony to
the improving effect of his society, from the relatives of those
who had profited by it.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782"
class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>“No man (says he) knows what death is; yet men fear it as if they
knew well that it was the greatest of all evils, which is just a
case of that worst of all ignorance, the conceit of knowing what you
do not really know. For my part, this is the exact point on which
I differ from most other men, if there be any one thing in which
I am wiser than they; as I know nothing about Hades, so I do not
pretend to any knowledge; but I do know well, that disobedience to
a person better than myself, either god or man, is both an evil and
a shame; nor will I ever embrace evil certain, in order to escape
evil which may for aught I know be a good.<a id="FNanchor_783"
href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> Perhaps you may feel
indignant at the resolute tone of my defence; you may have expected
that I should do as most others do in less dangerous trials than
mine; that I should weep, beg and entreat for my life, and bring
forward my children and relatives to do the same. I have relatives
like other men, and three children; but not one of them shall appear
before you for any such purpose. Not from any insolent dispositions
on my part, nor any wish to put a slight upon you, but because I
hold such conduct to be degrading to the reputation which I enjoy;
for I <i>have</i> a reputation for superiority among you, deserved or
undeserved as it may be. It is a disgrace to Athens, when her
esteemed men lower themselves, as they do but too often, by such
mean and cowardly supplications; and you dikasts, instead of being
prompted thereby to spare them, ought rather to condemn them the more
for so dishonoring the city.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784"
class="fnanchor">[784]</a> Apart from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_481">[p. 481]</span> any reputation of mine, too, I should
be a guilty man, if I sought to bias you by supplications. My duty
is to instruct and persuade you, if I can; but you have sworn to
follow your convictions in judging according to the laws, not to
make the laws bend to your partiality; and it is your duty so to do.
Far be it from me to habituate you to perjury; far be it from you to
contract any such habit. Do not, therefore, require of me proceedings
dishonorable in reference to myself, as well as criminal and impious
in regard to you, especially at a moment when I am myself rebutting
an accusation of impiety advanced by Melêtus. I leave to you and to
the god, to decide as may turn out best both for me and for you.”<a
id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>No one who reads the “Platonic Apology” of Sokratês will ever wish
that he had made any other defence. But it is the speech of one who
deliberately foregoes the immediate purpose of a defence, persuasion
of his judges; who speaks for posterity, without regard to his own
life: “solâ posteritatis curâ, et abruptis vitæ blandimentis.”<a
id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The
effect produced upon the dikasts was such as Sokratês anticipated
beforehand, and heard afterwards without surprise as without
discomposure, in the verdict of guilty. His only surprise was, at the
extreme smallness of the majority whereby that verdict was passed.<a
id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
And this is the true matter for astonishment. Never before had
the Athenian dikasts heard such a speech addressed to them. While
all of them, doubtless, knew Sokratês as a very able and very
eccentric man, respecting his purposes and character they would
differ; some regarding him with unqualified hostility, a few others
with respectful admiration, and a still larger number with simple
admiration for ability, without any decisive sentiment either
of antipathy or esteem.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[p.
482]</span> But by all these three categories, hardly excepting even
his admirers, the speech would be felt to carry one sting which
never misses its way to the angry feelings of the judicial bosom,
whether the judges in session be one or a few or many, the sting of
“affront to the court.” The Athenian dikasts were always accustomed
to be addressed with deference, often with subservience: they now
heard themselves lectured by a philosopher who stood before them like
a fearless and invulnerable superior, beyond their power, though
awaiting their verdict; one who laid claim to a divine mission, which
probably many of them believed to be an imposture, and who declared
himself the inspired uprooter of “conceit of knowledge without the
reality,” which purpose many would not understand, and some would not
like. To many, his demeanor would appear to betray an insolence not
without analogy to Alkibiadês or Kritias, with whom his accuser had
compared him. I have already remarked, in reference to his trial,
that, considering the number of personal enemies whom he made, the
wonder is, not that he was tried at all, but that he was not tried
until so late in his life: I now remark in reference to the verdict,
that, considering his speech before the dikastery, we cannot be
surprised that he was found guilty, but only that such verdict passed
by so small a majority as five or six.</p>

<p>That the condemnation of Sokratês was brought on distinctly by
the tone and tenor of his defence, is the express testimony of
Xenophon. “Other persons on trial (he says) defended themselves in
such manner as to conciliate the favor of the dikasts, or flatter,
or entreat them, contrary to the laws, and thus obtained acquittal.
But Sokratês would resort to nothing of this customary practice of
the dikastery contrary to the laws. Though <i>he might easily have
been let off by the dikasts, if he would have done anything of the
kind even moderately</i>, he preferred rather to adhere to the laws and
die, than to save his life by violating them.”<a id="FNanchor_788"
href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> Now no one in
Athens except Sokratês, probably, would have construed the laws as
requiring the tone of oration which he adopted; nor would he himself
have so construed them, if he had been twenty<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_483">[p. 483]</span> years younger, with less of acquired
dignity, and more years of possible usefulness open before him.
Without debasing himself by unbecoming flattery or supplication,
he would have avoided lecturing them as a master and superior,<a
id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a>
or ostentatiously asserting a divine mission for purposes which
they would hardly understand, or an independence of their verdict
which they might construe as defiance. The rhetor Lysias is said
to have sent to him a composed speech for his defence, which he
declined to use, not thinking it suitable to his dignity. But such
a man as Lysias would hardly compose what would lower the dignity
even of the loftiest client, though he would look to the result
also; nor is there any doubt that if Sokratês had pronounced it,—or
even a much less able speech, if inoffensive,—he would have been
acquitted. Quintilian,<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790"
class="fnanchor">[790]</a> indeed, expresses his satisfaction that
Sokratês maintained that towering dignity which brought out the
rarest and most exalted of his attributes, but which at the same time
renounced all chance of acquittal. Few persons will dissent from this
criticism: but when we look at the sentence, as we ought in fairness
to do, from the point of view of the dikasts, justice will compel us
to admit that Sokratês deliberately brought it upon himself.</p>

<p>If the verdict of guilty was thus brought upon Sokratês by his
own consent and coöperation, much more may the same remark be made
respecting the capital sentence which followed it. In Athenian
procedure, the penalty inflicted was determined by a separate vote of
the dikasts, taken after the verdict of guilty. The accuser having
named the penalty which he thought suitable, the accused party on his
side named some lighter penalty upon himself; and between these two
the dikasts were called on to make their option, no third proposition
being admissible. The prudence of an accused party always induced him
to propose, even against himself, some measure of punishment which
the dikasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[p. 484]</span> might
be satisfied to accept, in preference to the heavier sentence invoked
by his antagonist.</p>

<p>Now Melêtus, in his indictment and speech against Sokratês, had
called for the infliction of capital punishment. It was for Sokratês
to make his own counter-proposition, and the very small majority,
by which the verdict had been pronounced, afforded sufficient proof
that the dikasts were no way inclined to sanction the extreme penalty
against him. They doubtless anticipated, according to the uniform
practice before the Athenian courts of justice, that he would suggest
some lesser penalty; fine, imprisonment, exile, disfranchisement,
etc. And had he done this purely and simply, there can be little
doubt that the proposition would have passed. But the language of
Sokratês, after the verdict, was in a strain yet higher than before
it; and his resolution to adhere to his own point of view, disdaining
the smallest abatement or concession, only the more emphatically
pronounced. “What counter proposition shall I make to you (he said)
as a substitute for the penalty of Melêtus? Shall I name to you the
treatment which I think I deserve at your hands? In that case, my
proposition would be that I should be rewarded with a subsistence
at the public expense in the prytaneum; for that is what I really
deserve as a public benefactor; one who has neglected all thought of
his own affairs, and embraced voluntary poverty, in order to devote
himself to your best interests, and to admonish you individually on
the serious necessity of mental and moral improvement. Assuredly, I
cannot admit that I have deserved from you any evil whatever; nor
would it be reasonable in me to propose exile or imprisonment, which
I know to be certain and considerable evils, in place of death, which
may perhaps be not an evil, but a good. I might, indeed, propose to
you a pecuniary fine; for the payment of <i>that</i> would be no evil. But
I am poor, and have no money: all that I could muster might perhaps
amount to a mina: and I therefore propose to you a fine of one mina,
as punishment on myself. Plato, and my other friends near me, desire
me to increase this sum to thirty minæ, and they engage to pay it for
me. A fine of thirty minæ, therefore, is the counter penalty which I
submit for your judgment.”<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791"
class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_485">[p. 485]</span></p> <p>Subsistence in the prytaneum at
the public expense, was one of the greatest honorary distinctions
which the citizens of Athens ever conferred; an emphatic token of
public gratitude. That Sokratês, therefore, should proclaim himself
worthy of such an honor, and talk of assessing it upon himself in
lieu of a punishment, before the very dikasts who had just passed
against him a verdict of guilty, would be received by them as nothing
less than a deliberate insult; a defiance of judicial authority,
which it was their duty to prove, to an opinionated and haughty
citizen, that he could not commit with impunity. The persons who
heard his language with the greatest distress, were doubtless Plato,
Krito, and his other friends around him; who, though sympathizing
with him fully, knew well that he was assuring the success of the
proposition of Melêtus,<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792"
class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and would regret that he should thus throw
away his life by what they would think an ill-placed and unnecessary
self-exaltation. Had he proposed, with little or no preface, the
substitute-fine of thirty minæ with which this part of his speech
concluded, there is every reason for believing that the majority of
dikasts would have voted for it.</p>

<p>The sentence of death passed against him, by what majority we
do not know. But Sokratês neither altered his tone, nor manifested
any regret for the language by which he had himself seconded the
purpose of his accusers. On the contrary, he told the dikasts, in
a short address prior to his departure for the prison, that he was
satisfied both with his own conduct and with the result. The divine
sign, he said, which was wont to restrain him, often on very small
occasions, both in deeds and in words, had never manifested itself
once to him throughout the whole day, neither when he came thither
at first, nor at any one point throughout his whole discourse.
The tacit acquiescence of this infallible monitor satisfied him
not only that he had spoken rightly, but that the sentence passed
was in reality no evil to him; that to die now was the best thing
which could befall him.<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793"
class="fnanchor">[793]</a> Either death was tantamount to a sound,
perpetual, and dreamless sleep, which in his judgment would be no
loss, but rather a gain, compared with the present life; or else,
if the common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[p. 486]</span>
mythes were true, death would transfer him to a second life in
Hades, where he would find all the heroes of the Trojan war, and
of the past generally, so as to pursue in conjunction with them
the business of mutual cross-examination, and debate on ethical
progress and perfection.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794"
class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the sentence really appeared to
Sokratês in this point of view, and to his friends also, after the
event had happened, though doubtless not at the time when they were
about to lose him. He took his line of defence advisedly, and with
full knowledge of the result. It supplied him with the fittest of
all opportunities for manifesting, in an impressive manner, both his
personal ascendency over human fears and weakness, and the dignity
of what he believed to be his divine mission. It took him away in
his full grandeur and glory, like the setting of the tropical sun,
at a moment when senile decay might be looked upon as close at hand.
He calculated that his defence and bearing on the trial would be the
most emphatic lesson which he could possibly read to the youth of
Athens; more emphatic, probably, than the sum total of those lessons
which his remaining life might suffice to give, if he shaped his
defence otherwise. This anticipation of the effect of the concluding
scene of his life, setting the seal on all his prior discourses,
manifests itself in portions of his concluding words to the dikasts,
wherein he tells them that they will not, by putting him to death,
rid themselves of the importunity of the cross-examining elenchus;
that numbers of young men, more restless and obtrusive than he,
already carried within them that impulse, which they would now
proceed to apply; his superiority having hitherto kept them back.<a
id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
It was thus the persuasion of Sokratês, that his removal would be
the signal for numerous apostles, putting forth with increased
energy that process of interrogatory test and spur to which he had
devoted his life, and which doubtless was to him far dearer and more
sacred than his life. Nothing could be more effective than his lofty
bearing on his trial, for inflaming the enthusiasm of young men thus
predisposed; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[p. 487]</span>
the loss of life was to him compensated by the missionary successors
whom he calculated on leaving behind.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, Sokratês would have drunk the cup of
hemlock in the prison, on the day after his trial. But it so happened
that the day of his sentence was immediately after that on which
the sacred ship started on its yearly ceremonial pilgrimage from
Athens to Delos, for the festival of Apollo. Until the return of this
vessel to Athens, it was accounted unholy to put any person to death
by public authority. Accordingly, Sokratês remained in prison,—and
we are pained to read, actually with chains on his legs,—during
the interval that this ship was absent, thirty days altogether.
His friends and companions had free access to him, passing nearly
all their time with him in the prison; and Krito had even arranged
a scheme for procuring his escape, by a bribe to the jailer.
This scheme was only prevented from taking effect by the decided
refusal of Sokratês to become a party in any breach of the law;<a
id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> a
resolution, which we should expect as a matter of course, after the
line which he had taken in his defence. His days were spent in the
prison, in discourse respecting ethical and human subjects, which had
formed the charm and occupation of his previous life: it is to the
last of these days that his conversation with Simmias, Kebês, and
Phædon, on the immortality of the soul is referred, in the Platonic
dialogue called “Phædon.” Of that conversation the main topics and
doctrines are Platonic rather than Sokratic. But the picture which
the dialogue presents of the temper and state of mind of Sokratês,
during the last hours of his life, is one of immortal beauty and
interest, exhibiting his serene and even playful equanimity, amidst
the uncontrollable emotions of his surrounding friends,—the genuine,
unforced persuasion, governing both his words and his acts, of what
he had pronounced before the dikasts, that the sentence of death
was no calamity to him,<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797"
class="fnanchor">[797]</a>—and the unabated maintenance of that
earnest interest in the improvement of man and society, which had
for so many years formed both his paramount motive and his active
occupation. The details of the last scene are given with minute
fidelity, even down to the moment of his dis<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_488">[p. 488]</span>solution; and it is consoling to remark
that the cup of hemlock—the means employed for executions by public
order at Athens—produced its effect by steps far more exempt from
suffering than any natural death which was likely to befall him.
Those who have read what has been observed above respecting the
strong religious persuasions of Sokratês, will not be surprised to
hear that his last words, addressed to Krito immediately before he
passed into a state of insensibility, were: “Krito, we owe a cock
to Æsculapius: discharge the debt, and by no means omit it.”<a
id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>Thus perished the “parens philosophiæ,” the first of ethical
philosophers; a man who opened to science both new matter, alike
copious and valuable; and a new method, memorable not less for its
originality and efficacy, than for the profound philosophical basis
on which it rests. Though Greece produced great poets, orators,
speculative philosophers, historians, etc., yet other countries
having the benefit of Grecian literature to begin with, have nearly
equalled her in all these lines, and surpassed her in some. But
where are we to look for a parallel to Sokratês, either in or out
of the Grecian world? The cross-examining elenchus, which he not
only first struck out, but wielded with such matchless effect and to
such noble purposes, has been mute ever since his last conversation
in the prison; for even his great successor Plato was a writer and
lecturer, not a colloquial dialectician. No man has ever been found
strong enough to bend his bow; much less, sure enough to use it as he
did. His life remains as the only evidence, but a very satisfactory
evidence, how much can be done by this sort of intelligent
interrogation; how powerful is the interest which it can be made to
inspire; how energetic the stimulus which it can apply in awakening
dormant reason and generating new mental power.</p>

<p>It has been often customary to exhibit Sokratês as a moral
preacher, in which character probably he has acquired to himself
the general reverence attached to his name. This is, indeed, a
true attribute, but not the characteristic or salient attribute,
nor that by which he permanently worked on mankind. On the other
hand, Arkesilaus, and the New Academy,<a id="FNanchor_799"
href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> a century and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[p. 489]</span> more afterwards,
thought that they were following the example of Sokratês—and Cicero
seems to have thought so too—when they reasoned against everything;
and when they laid it down as a system, that, against every
affirmative position, an equal force of negative argument might be
brought up as counterpoise. Now this view of Sokratês is, in my
judgment, not merely partial, but incorrect. He entertained no such
systematic distrust of the powers of the mind to attain certainty.
He laid down a clear, though erroneous line of distinction between
the knowable and the unknowable. About physics, he was more than a
skeptic; he thought that man could know nothing; the gods did not
intend that man should acquire any such information, and therefore
managed matters in such a way as to be beyond his ken, for all
except the simplest phenomena of daily wants; moreover, not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[p. 490]</span> only man could not
acquire such information, but ought not to labor after it. But
respecting the topics which concern man and society, the views of
Sokratês were completely the reverse. This was the field which the
gods had expressly assigned, not merely to human practice, but to
human study and acquisition of knowledge; a field, wherein, with
that view, they managed phenomena on principles of constant and
observable sequence, so that every man who took the requisite pains
might know them. Nay, Sokratês went a step further; and this forward
step is the fundamental conviction upon which all his missionary
impulse hinges. He thought that every man not only might know these
things but ought to know them; that he could not possibly act well,
unless he did know them; and that it was his imperious duty to learn
them as he would learn a profession; otherwise, he was nothing
better than a slave, unfit to be trusted as a free and accountable
being. Sokratês felt persuaded that no man could behave as a just,
temperate, courageous, pious, patriotic agent, unless he taught
himself to know correctly what justice, temperance, courage, piety,
and patriotism, etc., really were. He was possessed with the truly
Baconian idea, that the power of steady moral action depended upon,
and was limited by, the rational comprehension of moral ends and
means. But when he looked at the minds around him, he perceived that
few or none either had any such comprehension, or had ever studied
to acquire it; yet at the same time every man felt persuaded that he
did possess it, and acted confidently upon such persuasion. Here,
then, Sokratês found that the first outwork for him to surmount, was,
that universal “conceit of knowledge without the reality,” against
which he declares such emphatic war; and against which, also, though
under another form of words and in reference to other subjects, Bacon
declares war not less emphatically, two thousand years afterwards:
“Opinio copiæ inter causas inopiæ est.” Sokratês found that those
notions respecting human and social affairs, on which each man
relied and acted, were nothing but spontaneous products of the
“intellectus sibi permissus,” of the intellect left to itself either
without any guidance, or with only the blind guidance of sympathies,
antipathies, authority, or silent assimilation. They were products
got together, to use Bacon’s language, “from much faith and much
chance, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[p. 491]</span>
the primitive suggestions of boyhood,” not merely without care or
study, but without even consciousness of the process, and without
any subsequent revision. Upon this basis the sophists, or professed
teachers for active life, sought to erect a superstructure of virtue
and ability; but to Sokratês, such an attempt appeared hopeless
and contradictory—not less impracticable than Bacon in his time
pronounced it to be, to carry up the tree of science into majesty
and fruit-bearing, without first clearing away those fundamental
vices which lay unmolested and in poisonous influence round its root.
Sokratês went to work in the Baconian manner and spirit; bringing
his cross-examining process to bear, as the first condition to all
further improvement, upon these rude, self-begotten, incoherent
generalizations, which passed in men’s minds for competent and
directing knowledge. But he, not less than Bacon, performs this
analysis, not with a view to finality in the negative, but as
the first stage towards an ulterior profit; as the preliminary
purification, indispensable to future positive result. In the
physical sciences, to which Bacon’s attention was chiefly turned, no
such result could be obtained without improved experimental research,
bringing to light facts new and yet unknown; but on those topics
which Sokratês discussed, the elementary data of the inquiry were all
within the hearer’s experience, requiring only to be pressed upon
his notice, affirmatively as well as negatively, together with the
appropriate ethical and political end; in such manner as to stimulate
within him the rational effort requisite for combining them anew upon
consistent principles.</p>

<p>If, then, the philosophers of the New Academy considered Sokratês
either as a skeptic, or as a partisan of systematic negation,
they misinterpreted his character, and mistook the first stage
of his process—that which Plato, Bacon, and Herschel call the
purification of the intellect—for the ultimate goal. The elenchus,
as Sokratês used it, was animated by the truest spirit of positive
science, and formed an indispensable precursor to its attainment.<a
id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<p>There are two points, and two points only, in topics concerning
man and society, with regard to which Sokratês is a skeptic;
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[p. 492]</span> rather,
which he denies; and on the negation of which, his whole method and
purpose turn. He denies, first, that men can know that on which
they have bestowed no conscious effort, no deliberate pains, no
systematic study, in learning. He denies, next, that men can practise
what they do not know;<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801"
class="fnanchor">[801]</a> that they can be just, or temperate, or
virtuous generally, without knowing what justice, or temperance, or
virtue is. To imprint upon the minds of his hearers his own negative
conviction, on these two points is, indeed, his first object, and
the primary purpose of his multiform dialectical manœuvring. But
though negative in his means, Sokratês is strictly positive in his
ends; his attack is undertaken only with distinct view to a positive
result; in order to shame them out of the illusion of knowledge, and
to spur them on and arm them for the acquisition of real, assured,
comprehensive, self-explanatory knowledge, as the condition and
guarantee of virtuous practice. Sokratês was, indeed, the reverse
of a skeptic; no man ever looked upon life with a more positive and
practical eye; no man ever pursued his mark with a clearer perception
of the road which he was travelling; no man ever combined, in like
manner, the absorbing enthusiasm of a missionary,<a id="FNanchor_802"
href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> with the acuteness,
the originality, the inventive resource, and the generalizing
comprehension, of a philosopher.</p>

<p>His method yet survives, as far as such method can survive, in
some of the dialogues of Plato. It is a process of eternal value
and of universal application. That purification of the intellect,
which Bacon signalized as indispensable for rational or scientific
progress, the Sokratic elenchus affords the only known instrument
for at least partially accomplishing. However little that instrument
may have been applied since the death of its<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_493">[p. 493]</span> inventor, the necessity and use of it
neither have disappeared, nor ever can disappear. There are few men
whose minds are not more or less in that state of sham knowledge
against which Sokratês made war: there is no man whose notions have
not been first got together by spontaneous, unexamined, unconscious,
uncertified association, resting upon forgotten particulars, blending
together disparates or inconsistencies, and leaving in his mind old
and familiar phrases, and oracular propositions, of which he has
never rendered to himself account: there is no man, who, if he be
destined for vigorous and profitable scientific effort, has not found
it a necessary branch of self-education, to break up, disentangle,
analyze, and reconstruct, these ancient mental compounds; and who
has not been driven to do it by his own lame and solitary efforts,
since the giant of the colloquial elenchus no longer stands in the
market-place to lend him help and stimulus.</p>

<p>To hear of any man,<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803"
class="fnanchor">[803]</a> especially of so illustrious a man,
being condemned to death on such accusations as that of heresy and
alleged corruption of youth, inspires at the present day a sentiment
of indignant reprobation, the force of which I have no desire to
enfeeble. The fact stands eternally recorded as one among the
thousand misdeeds of intolerance, religious and political. But since
amidst this catalogue each item has its own peculiar character,
grave or light, we are bound to consider at what point of the scale
the condemnation of Sokratês is to be placed, and what inferences
it justifies in regard to the character of the Athenians. Now if
we examine the circumstances of the case, we shall find them all
extenuating; and so powerful, indeed, as to reduce such inferences
to their minimum, consistent with the general class to which the
incident belongs.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[p.
494]</span></p> <p>First, the sentiment now prevalent is founded
upon a conviction that such matters as heresy and heretical teaching
of youth are not proper for judicial cognizance. Even in the modern
world, such a conviction is of recent date; and in the fifth
century <small>B.C.</small> it was unknown. Sokratês
himself would not have agreed in it; and all Grecian governments,
oligarchical and democratical alike, recognized the opposite. The
testimony furnished by Plato is on this point decisive. When we
examine the two positive communities which he constructs, in the
treatises “De Republicâ” and “De Legibus,” we find that there
is nothing about which he is more anxious, than to establish
an unresisted orthodoxy of doctrine, opinion, and education. A
dissenting and free-spoken teacher, such as Sokratês was at Athens,
would not have been allowed to pursue his vocation for a week, in the
Platonic Republic. Plato would not, indeed, condemn him to death;
but he would put him to silence, and in case of need send him away.
This, in fact, is the consistent deduction, if you assume that the
state is to determine what <i>is</i> orthodoxy and orthodox teaching,
and to repress what contradicts its own views. Now all the Grecian
states, including Athens, held this principle<a id="FNanchor_804"
href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> of interference
against the dissenting teacher. But at Athens, though the principle
was recognized, yet the application of it was counteracted by
resisting forces which it did not find elsewhere; by the democratical
constitution, with its liberty of speech and love of speech, by the
more active spring of individual intellect, and by the toleration,
greater there than anywhere else, shown to each man’s peculiarities
of every sort. In any other government of Greece, as well as in the
Platonic Republic, Sokratês would have been quickly arrested in his
career, even if not severely punished; in Athens, he was allowed to
talk and teach publicly for twenty-five or thirty years, and then
condemned when an old man. Of these two applications of the same
mischievous principle, assuredly the latter is at once the more
moderate and the less noxious.</p>

<p>Secondly, the force of this last consideration, as an extenuating
circumstance in regard to the Athenians, is much increased, when we
reflect upon the number of individual enemies whom Sokratês made to
himself in the prosecution of his cross-examining process.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[p. 495]</span> Here were a multitude
of individuals, including men personally the most eminent and
effective in the city, prompted by special antipathies, over
and above general convictions, to call into action the dormant
state-principle of intolerance against an obnoxious teacher. If,
under such provocation, he was allowed to reach the age of seventy,
and to talk publicly for so many years, before any real Melêtus stood
forward, this attests conspicuously the efficacy of the restraining
dispositions among the people, which made their practical habits more
liberal than their professed principles.</p>

<p>Thirdly, whoever has read the account of the trial and defence
of Sokratês, will see that he himself contributed quite as much to
the result as all the three accusers united. Not only he omitted
to do all that might have been done without dishonor, to insure
acquittal, but he held positive language very nearly such as
Melêtus himself would have sought to put in his mouth. He did this
deliberately,—having an exalted opinion both of himself and his own
mission,—and accounting the cup of hemlock, at his age, to be no
calamity. It was only by such marked and offensive self-exaltation
that he brought on the first vote of the dikastery, even then the
narrowest majority, by which he was found guilty: it was only by a
still more aggravated manifestation of the same kind, even to the
pitch of something like insult, that he brought on the second vote,
which pronounced the capital sentence. Now it would be uncandid not
to allow for the effect of such a proceeding on the minds of the
dikastery. They were not at all disposed, of their own accord, to put
in force the recognized principle of intolerance against him. But
when they found that the man who stood before them charged with this
offence, addressed them in a tone such as dikasts had never heard
before and could hardly hear with calmness, they could not but feel
disposed to credit all the worst inferences which his accusers had
suggested, and to regard Sokratês as a dangerous man both religiously
and politically, against whom it was requisite to uphold the majesty
of the court and constitution.</p>

<p>In appreciating this memorable incident, therefore, though the
mischievous principle of intolerance cannot be denied, yet all
the circumstances show that that principle was neither irritable
nor predominant in the Athenian bosom; that even a large body of
collateral antipathies did not readily call it forth against any
indi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[p. 496]</span>vidual;
that the more liberal and generous dispositions, which deadened its
malignity, were of steady efficacy, not easily overborne; and that
the condemnation ought to count as one of the least gloomy items in
an essentially gloomy catalogue.</p>

<p>Let us add, that as Sokratês himself did not account his own
condemnation and death, at his age, to be any misfortune, but rather
a favorable dispensation of the gods, who removed him just in
time to escape that painful consciousness of intellectual decline
which induced Demokritus to prepare the poison for himself, so his
friend Xenophon goes a step further, and while protesting against
the verdict of guilty, extols the manner of death as a subject of
triumph; as the happiest, most honorable, and most gracious way, in
which the gods could set the seal upon a useful and exalted life.<a
id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>It is asserted by Diodorus, and repeated with exaggerations
by other later authors, that after the death of Sokratês the
Athenians bitterly repented of the manner in which they had treated
him, and that they even went so far as to put his accusers to
death without trial.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806"
class="fnanchor">[806]</a> I know not upon what authority this
statement is made, and I disbelieve it altogether. From the tone of
Xenophon’s “Memorabilia,” there is every reason to presume that the
memory of Sokratês still continued to be unpopular at Athens when
that collection was composed. Plato, too, left Athens immediately
after the death of his master, and remained absent for a long series
of years: indirectly, I think, this affords a presumption that no
such reaction took place in Athenian sentiment as that which Diodorus
alleges; and the same presumption is countenanced by the manner in
which the orator Æschinês speaks of the condemnation, half a century
afterwards. I see no reason to believe that the Athenian dikasts,
who doubtless felt themselves justified, and more than justified, in
condemning Sokratês after his own speech, retracted that sentiment
after his decease.</p>

of Lysias (Orat. xxv, Δήμου Καταλύσεως Ἀπολογία, c. 3, p. 766,
Reisk.) that Phrynichus and Peisander embarked in this oligarchical
conspiracy for the purpose of getting clear of previous crimes
committed under the democracy. But there is nothing to countenance
this assertion, and the narrative of Thucydidês gives quite a
different color to their behavior.</p>

<p>Peisander was now serving with the armament at Samos; moreover,
his forwardness and energy—presently to be described—in taking the
formidable initiative of putting down the Athenian democracy, is to
me quite sufficient evidence that the taunts of the comic writers
against his cowardice are unfounded. Xenophon in the Symposion
repeats this taunt (ii, 14) which also appears in Aristophanês,
Eupolis, Plato Comicus, and others: see the passages collected in
Meineke, Histor. Critic. Comicor. Græcorum, vol. i, p. 178, etc.</p>

καὶ ἀρχαῖς, political and judicial associations, see above, in this
History, vol. iv, ch. xxxvii, pp. 399, 400; vol. vi, ch. li. pp. 290,
291: see also Hermann Büttner, Geschichte der politischen Hetærieen
zu Athen. pp. 75, 79, Leipsic, 1840.</p>

<p>There seem to have been similar political clubs or associations at
Carthage, exercising much influence, and holding perpetual banquets
as a means of largess to the poor, Aristotel. Polit. ii, 8, 2;
Livy, xxxiii, 46; xxxiv, 61; compare Kluge, ad Aristotel. De Polit.
Carthag. pp. 46-127, Wratisl. 1824.</p>

<p>The like political associations were both of long duration
among the nobility of Rome, and of much influence for political
objects as well as judicial success: “coitiones (compare Cicero
pro Cluentio, c. 54, s. 148) honorum adipiscendorum causâ factæ,
factiones, sodalitates.” The incident described in Livy (ix. 26) is
remarkable. The senate, suspecting the character and proceedings
of these clubs, appointed the dictator Mænius (in 312 <small>B.C.</small>) as commissioner with full power to
investigate and deal with them. But such was the power of the clubs,
in a case where they had a common interest and acted in coöperation
(as was equally the fact under Peisander at Athens), that they
completely frustrated the inquiry, and went on as before. “Nec
diutius, <i>ut fit, quam dum recens erat, quæstio per clara nomina
reorum viguit</i>: inde labi cœpit ad viliora capita, <i>donec coitionibus
factionibusque, adversus quas comparata erat, oppressa est</i>.”
(Livy. ix, 26.) Compare Dio. Cass. xxxvii, 57, about the ἑταιρικὰ
of the Triumvirs at Rome. Quintus Cicero (de Petition. Consulat. c.
5) says to his brother, the orator: “Quod si satis grati homines
essent, hæc omnia (<i>i.e.</i> all the <i>subsidia</i> necessary for success
in his coming election) tibi parata esse debebant, sicut parata esse
confido. Nam hoc biennio quatuor <i>sodalitates</i> civium ad ambitionem
gratiosissimorum tibi obligasti.... Horum in causis ad te deferundis
<i>quidnam eorum sodales tibi receperint et confirmarint</i>, scio; nam
interfui.”</p>

<p>See Th. Mommsen, De Collegiis et Sodaliciis Romanorum, Kiel, 1843,
ch. iii, sects. 5, 6, 7; also the Dissertation of Wunder, inserted in
the Onomasticon Tullianum of Orelli and Baiter, in the last volume of
their edition of Cicero, pp. 200-210, ad Ind. Legum; <i>Lex Licinia de
Sodalitiis</i>.</p>

<p>As an example of these clubs or conspiracies for mutual support
in ξυνωμοσίαι ἐπὶ δίκαις (not including ἀρχαῖς, so far as we can
make out), we may cite the association called οἱ Εἰκαδεῖς, made
known to us by an Inscription recently discovered in Attica, and
published first in Dr. Wordsworth’s Athens and Attica, p. 223; next
in Ross, Die Demen von Attica, Preface, p. v. These Εἰκαδεῖς are
an association, the members of which are bound to each other by a
common oath, as well as by a curse which the mythical hero of the
association, Eikadeus, is supposed to have imprecated (ἐνάντιον τῇ
ἄρᾳ ἣν Εἰκαδεὺς ἐπηράσατο); they possess common property, and it was
held contrary to the oath for any of the members to enter into a
pecuniary process against the κοινόν: compare analogous obligations
among the Roman Sodales, Mommsen, p. 4. Some members had violated
their obligation upon this point: Polyxenus had attacked them at law
for false witness: and the general body of the Eikadeis pass a vote
of thanks to him for so doing, and choose three of their members to
assist him in the cause before the dikastery (οἳτινες συναγωνιοῦνται
τῷ ἐπεσκημμένῳ τοῖς μάρτυσι): compare the ἑταιρίαι alluded to in
Demosthenês (cont. Theokrin. c. 11, p. 1335) as assisting Theokrinês
before the dikastery, and intimidating the witnesses.</p>

<p>The Guilds in the European cities during the Middle Ages, usually
sworn to by every member, and called <i>conjurationes Amicitiæ</i>, bear
in many respects a resemblance to these ξυνωμοσίαι; though the
judicial proceedings in the mediæval cities, being so much less
popular than at Athens, narrowed their range of interference in this
direction: their political importance, however, was quite equal.
(See Wilda, Das Gilden Wesen des Mittelalters, Abschn. ii, p. 167,
etc.)</p>

<p>“Omnes autem ad Amicitiam pertinentes villæ per <i>fidem et
sacramentum</i> firmaverunt, quod unus subveniat alteri tanquam fratri
suo in utili et honesto,” (ib. p. 148.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_19"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_19">[19]</a></span> The person described by Krito,
in the Euthydêmus of Plato (c. 31, p. 305, C.), as having censured
Sokratês for conversing with Euthydêmus and Dionysodorus, is
presented exactly like Antiphon in Thucydidês: ἥκιστα νὴ τὸν Δία
ῥήτωρ· οὐδὲ οἶμαι πώποτε αὐτὸν ἐπὶ δικαστήριον ἀναβεβηκέναι· ἀλλ᾽
ἐπαΐειν αὐτόν φασι περὶ τοῦ πράγματος, νὴ τὸν Δία, καὶ δεινὸν εἶναι
καὶ δεινοὺς λόγους ξυντιθέναι.</p>

<p>Heindorf thinks that Isokratês is here meant: Groen van Prinsterer
talks of Lysias; Winkelmann, of Thrasymachus. The description would
fit Antiphon as well as either of these three: though Stallbaum may
perhaps be right in supposing no particular individual to have been
in the mind of Plato.</p>

<p>Οἱ συνδικεῖν ἐπιστάμενοι, whom Xenophon specifies as being so
eminently useful to a person engaged in a lawsuit, are probably the
persons who knew how to address the dikastery effectively in support
of his case (Xenoph. Memorab. i, 2, 51).</p>

<em class="gesperrt">ὃς Ἀντισθένει ἐπιβάτης</em> ξυνέπλει, τοῦτον
κεκομισμένοι μετὰ τὸν Πεδαρίτου θάνατον ἄρχοντα, etc.</p>

<p>I do not see why the word ἐπιβάτης should not be construed here,
as elsewhere, in its ordinary sense of <i>miles classiarius</i>. The
commentators, see the notes of Dr. Arnold, Poppo, and Göller start
difficulties which seem to me of little importance; and they imagine
divers new meanings, for none of which any authority is produced. We
ought not to wonder that a common <i>miles classiarius</i>, or marine,
being a Spartan citizen, should be appointed commander at Chios,
when, a few chapters afterwards, we find Thrasybulus at Samos
promoted, from being a common hoplite in the ranks, to be one of the
Athenian generals (viii. 73).</p>

<p>The like remark may be made on the passage cited from Xenophon
(Hellenic. i. 3, 17), about Hegesandridas—ἐπιβάτης ὢν Μινδάρου, where
also the commentators reject the common meaning (see Schneider’s note
in the Addenda to his edition of 1791, p. 97). The participle ὢν
in that passage must be considered as an inaccurate substitute for
γεγενημένος, since Mindarus was dead at the time. Hegesandridas <i>had
been</i> among the epibatæ of Mindarus, and was <i>now</i> in command of a
squadron on the coast of Thrace.</p>

<p>In my judgment ἑαυτοῦ is decidedly the proper reading here,
not ἑαυτῶν. I agree in this respect with Dr. Arnold, Bekker, and
Göller.</p>

<p>In a former volume of this History, I have shown reasons for
believing, in opposition to Mitford, Dahlmann, and others, that the
treaty called by the name of Kallias, and sometimes miscalled by the
name of Kimon, was a real fact and not a boastful fiction: see vol.

resenting this third demand.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold explains the words Ἕλληνες νεανίσκοι to mean some of
the members of the aristocratical clubs, or unions, formerly spoken
of. But I cannot think that Thucydidês would use such an expression
to designate Athenian citizens: neither is it probable that Athenian
citizens would be employed in repeated acts of such a character.</p>

<p id="Footnote_39"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_39">[39]</a></span> Even Peisander himself had
professed the strongest attachment to the democracy, coupled with
exaggerated violence against parties suspected of oligarchical plots,
four years before, in the investigations which followed on the
mutilation of the Hermæ at Athens (Andokidês de Myster. c. 9, 10,
sects. 36-43).</p>

<p>It is a fact that Peisander was one of the prominent movers on
both these two occasions, four years apart. And if we could believe
Isokratês (de Bigis, sects. 4-7, p. 347), the second of the two
occasions was merely the continuance and consummation of a plot
which had been projected and begun on the first, and in which the
conspirators had endeavored to enlist Alkibiadês. The latter refused,
so his son, the speaker in the above-mentioned oration, contends,
in consequence of his attachment to the democracy; upon which the
oligarchical conspirators, incensed at his refusal, got up the charge
of irreligion against him and procured his banishment.</p>

<p>Though Droysen and Wattenbach (De Quadringentorum Athenis
Factione, pp. 7, 8, Berlin, 1842) place confidence, to a considerable
extent, in this manner of putting the facts, I consider it to
be nothing better than complete perversion; irreconcilable with
Thucydidês, confounding together facts unconnected in themselves as
well as separated by a long interval of time, and introducing unreal
causes, for the purpose of making out, what was certainly not true,
that Alkibiadês was a faithful friend of the democracy, and even a
sufferer in its behalf.</p>

<p>In spite of certain passages found in Suidas and Harpokration (see
K. F. Hermann, Lehrbuch der Griechischen Staats Alterthümer, sect.
167, note 12: compare also Wattenbach, De Quadringentor. Factione,
p. 38), I cannot think that there was any connection between these
ten ξυγγραφεῖς, and the Board of πρόβουλοι mentioned as having been
before named (Thucyd. viii, 1). Nor has the passage in Lysias, to
which Hermann makes allusion, anything to do with these ξυγγραφεῖς.
The mention of Thirty persons by Androtion and Philochorus, seems to
imply that they, or Harpokration, confounded the proceedings ushering
in this oligarchy of Four Hundred, with those before the subsequent
oligarchy of Thirty. The σύνεδροι, or ξυγγραφεῖς, mentioned by
Isokratês (Areopagit. Or. vii, sect. 67) might refer either to the
case of the Four Hundred or to that of the Thirty.</p>

allegation, respecting the number of citizens who attended in the
Athenian democratical assemblies, has been sometimes cited as if
it carried with it the authority of Thucydidês; which is a great
mistake, duly pointed out by all the best recent critics. It is
simply the allegation of the Four Hundred, whose testimony, as a
guarantee for truth, is worth little enough.</p>

<p>That <i>no</i> assembly had ever been attended by so many as five
thousand (οὐδεπώποτε) I certainly am far from believing. It is not
improbable, however, that five thousand was an unusually large number
of citizens to attend.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold, in his note, opposes the allegation in part, by
remarking that “the law required not only the presence but the
sanction of at least six thousand citizens to some particular decrees
of the assembly.” It seems to me, however, quite possible that,
in cases where this large number of votes was required, as in the
ostracism, and where there was no discussion carried on immediately
before the voting, the process of voting may have lasted some hours,
like our keeping open of a poll. So that though more than six
thousand citizens must have <i>voted</i>, altogether, it was not necessary
that all should have been present in the same assembly.</p>

Tacitus characterizes an incident in some respects similar. The Roman
army, fighting in the cause of Vitellius against Vespasian, had been
betrayed by their general Cæcina, who endeavored to carry them over
to the latter: his army, however, refused to follow him, adhered to
their own cause, and put him under arrest. Being afterwards defeated
by the troops of Vespasian, and obliged to capitulate in Cremona,
they released Cæcina, and solicited his intercession to obtain
favorable terms. “Primores castrorum nomen atque imagines Vitellii
amoliuntur; catenas Cæcinæ (nam etiam tum vinctus erat) exsolvunt,
orantque, ut causæ suæ deprecator adsistat: aspernantem tumentemque

πεντακισχιλίων ὅτι πάντες ἐν τῷ μέρει μεθέξουσιν, etc. I dissent
from Dr. Arnold’s construction of this passage, which is followed
both by Poppo and by Göller. He says, in his note: “The sense must
clearly be, ‘that all the citizens should be of the five thousand
in their turn,’ however strange the expression may seem, μεθέξουσι
τῶν πεντακισχιλίων. But without referring to the absurdity of the
meaning, that all the Five Thousand should partake of the government
<i>in their turn</i>,—for they <i>all</i> partook of it as being the sovereign
assembly,—yet μετέχειν, in this sense, would require τῶν πραγμάτων
after it, and would be at least as harsh, standing alone, as in the
construction of μεθέξουσι τῶν πεντακισχιλίων.”</p>

<p>Upon this remark, 1. Μετέχειν may be construed with a genitive
case not actually expressed, but understood out of the words
preceding; as we may see by Thucyd. ii, 16, where I agree with the
interpretation suggested by Matthiæ (Gr. Gr. § 325), rather than with
Dr. Arnold’s note.</p>

<p>2. In the present instance, we are not reduced to the necessity of
gathering a genitive case for μετέχειν by implication out of previous
phraseology: for the express genitive case stands there a line or
two before—<em class="gesperrt">τῆς πόλεως</em>, the idea of which
is carried down without being ever dropped: οἱ δ᾽ ἀπήγγελλον, ὡς
οὔτε ἐπὶ διαφθορᾷ <em class="gesperrt">τῆς πόλεως</em> ἡ μετάστασις
γένοιτο, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ σωτηρίᾳ, οὔθ᾽ ἵνα τοῖς πολεμίοις παραδοθῇ (i.&nbsp;e., ἡ
πόλις) ... τῶν τε πεντακισχιλίων ὅτι πάντες <em class="gesperrt">ἐν
τῷ μέρει μεθέξουσιν</em> (i.&nbsp;e., τῆς πόλεως).</p>

<p>There is therefore no harshness of expression; nor is there any
absurdity of meaning, as we may see by the repetition of the very
same in viii, 93, λέγοντες τούς τε πεντακισχιλίους ἀποφανεῖν, καὶ <em
class="gesperrt">ἐκ τούτων ἐν μέρει</em>, ᾗ ἂν τοῖς πεντακισχιλίοις
δοκῇ, <em class="gesperrt">τοὺς τετρακοσίους ἔσεσθαι</em>, etc.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold’s designation of these Five Thousand as “the sovereign
assembly,” is not very accurate. They were not an assembly at all:
they had never been called together, nor had anything been said
about an intention of calling them together: in reality, they were
but a fiction and a name; but even the Four Hundred themselves
pretended only to talk of them as partners in the conspiracy and
revolution, not as <i>an assembly</i> to be convoked—πεντακισχίλιοι—<em
class="gesperrt">οἱ πράσσοντες</em> (viii, 72).</p>

<p>As to the idea of bringing all the remaining citizens to equal
privileges, in rotation, with the Five Thousand, we shall see that it
was never broached until considerably after the Four Hundred had been
put down.</p>

μὲν σχῆμα πολιτικὸν τοῦ λόγου αὐτοῖς, κατ᾽ ἰδίας δὲ φιλοτιμίας οἱ
πολλοὶ αὐτῶν τῷ τοιούτῳ προσέκειντο, ἐν ᾧπερ καὶ μάλιστα ὀλιγαρχία

οὐχ ὅπως ἴσοι, ἀλλὰ καὶ πολὺ πρῶτος αὐτὸς ἕκαστος εἶναι· ἐκ δὲ
δημοκρατίας αἱρέσεως γιγνομένης, ῥᾷον τὰ ἀποβαίνοντα, ὡς οὐκ ἀπὸ τῶν
ὁμοίων, ἐλασσούμενός τις φέρει.</p>

<p>I give in the text what appears to me the proper sense of this
passage, the last words of which are obscure: see the long notes
of the commentators, especially Dr. Arnold and Poppo. Dr. Arnold
considers τῶν ὁμοίων as a neuter, and gives the paraphrase of the
last clause as follows: “Whereas under an old-established government,
they (ambitious men of talent) are prepared to fail: they know that
the weight of the government is against them, and are thus spared the
peculiar pain of being beaten in a fair race, when they and their
competitors start with equal advantages, and there is nothing to
lessen the mortification of defeat. Ἀπὸ τῶν ὁμοίων ἐλασσούμενος, is,
<i>being beaten when the game is equal, when the terms of the match are
fair</i>.”</p>

<p>I cannot concur in Dr. Arnold’s explanation of these words, or of
the general sense of the passage. He thinks that Thucydidês means
to affirm what applies generally “to an opposition minority when
it succeeds in revolutionizing the established government, whether
the government be a democracy or a monarchy; whether the minority
be an aristocratical party or a popular one.” It seems to me, on
the contrary, that the affirmation bears only on the special case
of an oligarchical conspiracy subverting a democracy, and that the
comparison taken is applicable only to the state of things as it
stood under the preceding democracy.</p>

<p>Next, the explanation given of the words by Dr. Arnold, assumes
that “to be beaten in a fair race, or when the terms of the match are
fair,” causes to the loser <i>the maximum</i> of pain and offence. This is
surely not the fact: or rather, the reverse is the fact. The man who
loses his cause or his election through unjust favor, jealousy, or
antipathy, is <i>more</i> hurt than if he had lost it under circumstances
where he could find no injustice to complain of. In both cases, he
is doubtless mortified; but if there be injustice, he is offended
and angry as well as mortified: he is disposed to take vengeance on
men whom he looks upon as his personal enemies. It is important to
distinguish the mortification of simple failure, from the discontent
and anger arising out of belief that the failure has been unjustly
brought about: it is this discontent, tending to break out in
active opposition, which Thucydidês has present to his mind in the
comparison which he takes between the state of feeling which precedes
and follows the subversion of the democracy.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the words τῶν ὁμοίων are masculine, and that
they have reference, like πάντες and ἴσοι, in the preceding line, to
the privileged minority of equal confederates who are supposed to
have just got possession of the government. At Sparta, the word οἱ
ὅμοιοι acquired a sort of technical sense, to designate the small
ascendent minority of wealthy Spartan citizens, who monopolized in
their own hands political power, to the practical exclusion of the
remainder (see Xenoph. Hellen. iii. 3, 5; Xenoph. Resp. Lac. x, 7;
xiii, 1; Demosth. cont. Lept. s. 88). Now these ὅμοιοι, or peers,
here indicated by Thucydidês as the peers of a recently-formed
oligarchy, are not merely equal among themselves, but rivals one with
another, and personally known to each other. It is important to bear
in mind all these attributes as tacitly implied, though not literally
designated or <i>connoted</i> by the word ὅμοιοι, or peers; because the
comparison instituted by Thucydidês is founded on all the attributes
taken together; just as Aristotle (Rhetoric, ii, 8; ii, 13, 4), in
speaking of the envy and jealousy apt to arise towards τοὺς ὁμοίους,
considers them as ἀντεράστας and ἀνταγωνίστας.</p>

<p>The Four Hundred at Athens were all peers,—equals, rivals, and
personally known among one another,—who had just raised themselves
by joint conspiracy to supreme power. Theramenês, one of the number,
conceives himself entitled to preëminence, but finds that he is shut
out from it, the men who shut him out being this small body of known
equals and rivals. He is inclined to impute the exclusion to personal
motives on the part of this small knot; to selfish ambition on the
part of each; to ill-will, to jealousy, to wrongful partiality;
so that he thinks himself injured, and the sentiment of injury is
embittered by the circumstance that those from whom it proceeds are
a narrow, known, and definite body of colleagues. Whereas, if his
exclusion had taken place under the democracy, by the suffrage of a
large, miscellaneous, and personally unknown collection of citizens,
he would have been far less likely to carry off with him a sense of
injury. Doubtless he would have been mortified; but he would not have
looked upon the electors in the light of jealous or selfish rivals,
nor would they form a definite body before him for his indignation
to concentrate itself upon. Thus Nikomachidês—whom Sokratês (see
Xenophon, Memor. iii, 4) meets returning mortified because the people
had chosen another person and not him as general—would have been not
only mortified, but angry and vindictive besides, if he had been
excluded by a few peers and rivals.</p>

<p>Such, in my judgment, is the comparison which Thucydidês wishes to
draw between the effect of disappointment inflicted by the suffrage
of a numerous and miscellaneous body of citizens, compared with
disappointment inflicted by a small knot of oligarchical peers upon
a competitor among their own number, especially at a moment when the
expectations of all these peers are exaggerated, in consequence of
the recent acquisition of their power. I believe the remark of the
historian to be quite just; and that the disappointment in the first
case is less intense, less connected with the sentiment of injury,
and less likely to lead to active manifestation of enmity. This is
one among the advantages of a numerous suffrage.</p>

<p>I cannot better illustrate the jealousies pretty sure to break
out among a small number of ὅμοιοι, or rival peers, than by the
description which Justin gives of the leading officers of Alexander
the Great, immediately after that monarch’s death (Justin, xii,
2):—</p>

<p>“Cæterum, occiso Alexandro, non, ut læti, ita et securi fuere,
omnibus unum locum competentibus: nec minus milites invicem se
timebant, quorum et libertas solutior et favor incertus erat. <i>Inter
ipsos vero æqualitas discordiam augebat</i>, nemine tantum cæteros
excedente, ut ei aliquis se submitteret.”</p>

<p>Compare Plutarch, Lysander, c. 23.</p>

<p>Haack and Poppo think that ὁμοίων cannot be masculine, because
<em class="gesperrt">ἀπὸ</em> τῶν ὁμοίων ἐλασσούμενος would not
then be correct, but ought to be <em class="gesperrt">ὑπὸ</em> τῶν
ὁμοίων ἐλασσούμενος. I should dispute, under all circumstances, the
correctness of this criticism: for there are quite enough parallel
cases to defend the use of ἀπὸ here, (see Thucyd. i, 17; iii, 82;
iv, 115; vi, 28, etc.) But we need not enter into the debate; for
the genitive τῶν ὁμοίων depends rather upon τὰ ἀποβαίνοντα which
precedes, than upon ἐλασσούμενος which follows; and the preposition
ἀπὸ is what we should naturally expect. To mark this, I have put a
comma after ἀποβαίνοντα as well as after ὁμοίων.</p>

<p>To show that an opinion is not correct, indeed, does not afford
<i>certain</i> evidence that Thucydidês may not have advanced it: for
he might be mistaken. But it ought to count as good presumptive
evidence, unless the words peremptorily bind us to the contrary,
which in this case they do not.</p>

before the people of Athens, De Reditu suo, sects. 10-15), that
during this spring he furnished the armament at Samos with wood
proper for the construction of oars, only obtained by the special
favor of Archelaus king of Macedonia, and of which the armament
then stood in great need. He farther alleges, that he afterwards
visited Athens, while the Four Hundred were in full dominion; and
that Peisander, at the head of this oligarchical body, threatened his
life for having furnished such valuable aid to the armament, then
at enmity with Athens. Though he saved his life by clinging to the
altar, yet he had to endure bonds and manifold hard treatment.</p>

<p>Of these claims, which Andokidês prefers to the favor of the
subsequent democracy, I do not know how much is true.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable passage, as indicating what is really meant
by προστάτης τοῦ δήμου: “the leader of a popular opposition.”
Theramenês, and the other persons here spoken of, did not even
mention the name of the democracy,—they took up simply the name of
the Five Thousand,—yet they are still called πρόσταται τοῦ δήμου,
inasmuch as the Five Thousand were a sort of qualified democracy,
compared to the Four Hundred.</p>

<p>The words denote the leader of a popular party, as opposed to
an oligarchical party (see Thucyd. iii, 70; iv, 66; vi, 35), in a
form of government either entirely democratical, or at least, in
which the public assembly is frequently convoked and decides on many
matters of importance. Thucydidês does not apply the words to any
Athenian except in the case now before us respecting Theramenês: he
does not use the words even with respect to Kleon, though he employs
expressions which seem equivalent to it (iii, 36; iv, 21)—ἀνὴρ
δημαγωγὸς κατ᾽ ἐκεῖνον τὸν χρόνον ὢν καὶ τῷ πλήθει πιθανώτατος,
etc. This is very different from the words which he applies to
Periklês—ὢν γὰρ <em class="gesperrt">δυνατώτατος</em> τῶν καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν
καὶ <em class="gesperrt">ἄγων τὴν πολιτείαν</em> (i, 127). Even
in respect to Nikias, he puts him in conjunction with Pleistoanax

<p>This task was confided to Polystratus, a very recent member of the

<p id="Footnote_102"><span class="label"><a

ξυνέλεγον, μίαν μὲν εὐθὺς τότε πρῶτον ἐς τὴν Πνύκα καλουμένην, οὗπερ
καὶ ἄλλοτε εἰώθεσαν, ἐν ᾗπερ καὶ τοὺς τετρακοσίους καταπαύσαντες <em
class="gesperrt">τοῖς πεντακισχιλίοις</em> ἐψηφίσαντο τὰ πράγματα
παραδοῦναι· <em class="gesperrt">εἶναι δὲ αὐτῶν, ὁπόσοι καὶ ὅπλα
παρέχονται</em>· καὶ μισθὸν μηδένα φέρειν, μηδεμιᾷ ἀρχῇ, εἰ δὲ μὴ,
ἐπάρατον ἐποιήσαντο. Ἐγίγνοντο δὲ καὶ ἄλλαι ὕστερον πυκναὶ ἐκκλησίαι,
ἀφ᾽ ὧν καὶ <em class="gesperrt">νομοθέτας καὶ τἄλλα ἐψηφίσαντο ἐς τὴν
πολιτείαν</em>.</p>

<p>In this passage I dissent from the commentators on two points.
First, they understand this number Five Thousand as a real definite
list of citizens, containing five thousand names, neither more nor
less. Secondly, they construe νομοθέτας, not in the ordinary meaning
which it bears in Athenian constitutional language, but in the
sense of ξυγγραφεῖς (c. 67), “persons to model the constitution,
corresponding to the ξυγγραφεῖς appointed by the aristocratical party
a little before,” to use the words of Dr. Arnold.</p>

<p>As to the first point, which is sustained also by Dr. Thirlwall
(Hist. Gr. ch. xxviii, vol. iv, p. 51, 2d ed.), Dr. Arnold really
admits what is the ground of my opinion, when he says: “Of course
the number of citizens capable of providing themselves with heavy
arms must <i>have much exceeded five thousand</i>: and it is said in the
defence of Polystratus, one of the Four Hundred (Lysias, p. 675,
Reisk.), that he drew up a list of nine thousand. But we must suppose
that all who could furnish heavy arms <i>were eligible into the number
of the Five Thousand</i>, whether the members were fixed on by lot, by
election, or by rotation; as it had been proposed to appoint the Four
Hundred by rotation out of the Five Thousand (viii, 93).”</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold here throws out a supposition which by no means
conforms to the exact sense of the words of Thucydidês—εἶναι δὲ
αὐτῶν, ὁπόσοι καὶ ὅπλα παρέχονται. These words distinctly signify,
that all who furnished heavy arms <i>should be of the Five Thousand,
should belong of right to that body</i>, which is something different
from <i>being eligible</i> into the number of the Five Thousand, either
by lot, rotation, or otherwise. The language of Thucydidês, when
he describes, in the passage referred to by Dr. Arnold, c. 93, the
projected formation of the Four Hundred by rotation out of the Five
Thousand, is very different: καὶ ἐκ τούτων ἐν μέρει τοὺς τετρακοσίους
ἔσεσθαι, etc. M. Boeckh (Public Economy of Athens, bk. ii, ch. 21,
p. 268, Eng. Tr.) is not satisfactory in his description of this
event.</p>

<p>The idea which I conceive of the Five Thousand, as a number
existing from the commencement only in talk and imagination, neither
realized nor intended to be realized, coincides with the full meaning
of this passage of Thucydidês, as well as with everything which he
had before said about them.</p>

<p>I will here add that ὁπόσοι ὅπλα παρέχονται means persons
furnishing arms, not for themselves alone, but for others also
(Xenoph. Hellen. iii, 4, 15.)</p>

<p>As to the second point, the signification of νομοθέτας, I stand
upon the general use of that word in Athenian political language: see
the explanation earlier in this History, vol. v, ch. xlvi, p. 373. It
is for the commentators to produce some justification of the unusual
meaning which they assign to it: “persons to model the constitution;
commissioners who drew up the new constitution,” as Dr. Arnold, in
concurrence with the rest, translates it. Until some justification is
produced, I venture to believe that νομοθέται, is a word which would
not be used in that sense with reference to nominees chosen by the
democracy, and intended to act with the democracy; for it implies a
final, decisive, authoritative determination; whereas the ξυγγραφεῖς,
or “commissioners to draw up a constitution,” were only invested with
the function of submitting something for approbation to the public
assembly or competent authority; that is, assuming that the public
assembly remained an efficient reality.</p>

<p>Moreover, the words καὶ τἄλλα would hardly be used in immediate
sequence to νομοθέτας, if the latter word meant that which the
commentators suppose: “Commissioners for framing a constitution, <i>and
the other things towards the constitution</i>.” Such commissioners are
surely far too prominent and initiative in their function to be named
in this way. Let us add, that the most material items in the new
constitution, if we are so to call it, have already been distinctly
specified as settled by public vote, before these νομοθέται are even
named.</p>

<p>It is important to notice, that even the Thirty, who were named
six years afterwards to draw up a constitution, at the moment when
Sparta was mistress of Athens, and when the people were thoroughly
put down, are not called Νομοθέται, but are named by a circumlocution
equivalent to Ἔδοξε τῷ δήμῳ, τριάκοντα ἄνδρας ἑλέσθαι, οἳ τοὺς
πατρίους νόμους συγγράψουσι, καθ᾽ οὓς πολιτεύσουσι.—Αἱρεθέντες δὲ,
ἐφ᾽ ᾧ τε συγγράψαι νόμους καθ᾽ οὕστινας πολιτεύσοιντο, τούτους μὲν
ἀεὶ ἔμελλον ξυγγράφειν τε καὶ ἀποδεικνύναι, etc. (Xenophon, Hellen.
ii, 3, 2-11.) Xenophon calls Kritias and Chariklês the nomothetæ of
the Thirty (Memor. i, 2, 30), but this is not democracy.</p>

<p>For the signification of Νομοθέτης (applied most generally to
Solon, sometimes to others, either by rhetorical looseness or by
ironical taunt), or Νομοθέται, a numerous body of persons chosen
and sworn, see Lysias cont. Nikomach. sects. 3, 33, 37; Andokidês
de Mysteriis, sects. 81-85, c. 14, p. 38, where the nomothetæ are a
sworn body of Five Hundred, exercising, conjointly with the senate,
the function of accepting or rejecting laws proposed to them.</p>

before been members of the oligarchical conspiracy. Perhaps it may
also be intended to abrogate the covenant sworn by the members of

pledged them to anti-constitutional acts (Thucyd. viii, 54-81).</p>

the memory and the death of Phrynichus, preceded the trial of
Antiphon, we may gather from the concluding words of the sentence
passed upon Antiphon: see Plutarch, Vit. x, Oratt. p. 834, B: compare
Schol. Aristoph. Lysistr. 313.</p>

<p>Both Lysias and Lykurgus, the orators, contain statements about
the death of Phrynichus which are not in harmony with Thucydidês.
Both these orators agree in reporting the names of the two foreigners
who claimed to have slain Phrynichus, and whose claim was allowed by
the people afterwards, in a formal reward and vote of citizenship,
Thrasybulus of Kalydon, Apollodorus of Megara (Lysias cont. Agorat.
c. 18, 492; Lykurg. cont. Leokrat. c. 29, p. 217).</p>

<p>Lykurgus says that Phrynichus was assassinated by night, “near the
fountain, hard by the willow-trees:” which is quite contradictory
to Thucydidês, who states that the deed was done in daylight, and
in the market-place. Agoratus, against whom the speech of Lysias is
directed, pretended to have been one of the assassins, and claimed
reward on that score.</p>

<p>The story of Lykurgus, that the Athenian people, on the
proposition of Kritias, exhumed and brought to trial the dead body
of Phrynichus, and that Aristarchus and Alexiklês were put to death
for undertaking its defence, is certainly in part false, and probably
wholly false. Aristarchus was then at Œnoê, Alexiklês at Dekeleia.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_120"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_120">[120]</a></span> Onomaklês had been one of the
colleagues of Phrynichus, as general of the armament in Ionia, in the
preceding autumn (Thucyd. viii, 25).</p>

<p>In one of the Biographies of Thucydidês (p. xxii, in Dr. Arnold’s
edition), it is stated that Onomaklês was executed along with the
other two; but the document cited in the Pseudo-Plutarch contradicts
this.</p>

Pseudo-Plutarch, Vit. x, Oratt. pp. 833, 834. It was preserved by
Cæcilius, a Sicilian and rhetorical teacher, of the Augustan age; who
possessed sixty orations ascribed to Antiphon, twenty-five of which
he considered spurious.</p>

<p>Antiphon left a daughter, whom Kallæschrus sued for in marriage,
pursuant to the forms of law, being entitled to do so on the score of
near relationship (ἐπεδικάσατο). Kallæschrus was himself one of the
Four Hundred, perhaps a brother of Kritias. It seems singular that
the legal power of suing at law for a female in marriage, by right of
near kin (τοῦ ἐπιδικάζεσθαι), could extend to a female disfranchised
and debarred from all rights of citizenship.</p>

<p>If we may believe Harpokration, Andron, who made the motion in
the senate for sending Antiphon and Archeptolemus to trial, had been
himself a member of the Four Hundred oligarchs, as well as Theramenês
(Harp. v. Ἄνδρων).</p>

<p>The note of Dr. Arnold upon that passage (viii, 68) wherein
Thucydidês calls Antiphon ἀρετῇ οὐδενὸς ὕστερος, “inferior to no man
in virtue,” well deserves to be consulted. This passage shows, in
a remarkable manner, what were the political and private qualities
which determined the esteem of Thucydidês. It shows that his
sympathies went along with the oligarchical party; and that, while
the exaggerations of opposition-speakers, or demagogues, such as
those which he imputes to Kleon and Hyperbolus, provoked his bitter
hatred, exaggerations of the oligarchical warfare, or multiplied
assassinations, did not make him like a man the worse. But it shows,
at the same time, his great candor in the narration of facts: for he
gives an undisguised revelation both of the assassinations, and of
the treason, of Antiphon.</p>

This is the natural meaning of the passage; though it <i>may</i> also
mean that a day for trial was named, but that Aristarchus did not
appear. Aristarchus may possibly have been made prisoner in one of
the engagements which took place between the garrison of Dekeleia and
the Athenians. The Athenian exiles in a body established themselves
at Dekeleia, and carried on constant war with the citizens at Athens:
see Lysias, De Bonis Niciæ Fratris, Or. xviii, ch. 4, p. 604: Pro

<p>From the psephism of Patrokleidês, passed six years subsequently,
after the battle of Ægospotamos, we learn that the names of such
among the Four Hundred as did not stay to take their trial, were
engraved on pillars distinct from those who were tried and condemned
either to fine or to various disabilities; Andokidês de Mysteriis,
sects. 75-78: Καὶ ὅσα ὀνόματα τῶν τετρακοσίων τινὸς ἐγγέγραπται, ἢ
ἄλλο τι περὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ πραχθέντων ἔστι που γεγραμμένον,
<em class="gesperrt">πλὴν ὁπόσα ἐν στήλαις γέγραπται τῶν μὴ ἐνθάδε
μεινάντων</em>, etc. These last names, as the most criminal, were
excepted from the amnesty of Patrokleidês.</p>

<p>We here see that there were two categories among the condemned
Four Hundred: 1. Those who remained to stand the trial of
accountability, and were condemned either to a fine which they could
not pay, or to some positive disability. 2. Those who did not remain
to stand their trial, and were condemned <i>par contumace</i>.</p>

<p>Along with the first category we find other names besides those of
the Four Hundred, found guilty as their partisans: ἄλλο τι (ὄνομα)
περὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ ὀλιγαρχίᾳ πραχθέντων. Among these partisans we may
rank the soldiers mentioned a little before, sect. 75: οἱ στρατιῶται,
οἷς ὅτι <em class="gesperrt">ἐπέμειναν ἐπὶ τῶν τυράννων</em> ἐν τῇ
πόλει, τὰ μὲν ἄλλα ἦν ἅπερ τοῖς ἄλλοις πολίταις, εἰπεῖν δ᾽ ἐν τῷ
δήμῳ οὐκ ἐξῆν αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ βουλεῦσαι, where the preposition ἐπὶ seems
to signify not simply contemporaneousness, but a sort of intimate
connection, like the phrase ἐπὶ προστάτου οἰκεῖν (see Matthiæ, Gr.
Gr. sect. 584; Kühner, Gr. Gr. sect. 611).</p>

<p>The oration of Lysias pro Polystrato is on several points obscure:
but we make out that Polystratus was one of the Four Hundred who did
not come to stand his trial of accountability, and was therefore
condemned in his absence. Severe accusations were made against him,
and he was falsely asserted to be the cousin, whereas he was in
reality only fellow-demot, of Phrynichus (sects. 20, 24, 11). The
defence explains his non-appearance, by saying that he had been
wounded at the battle of Eretria, and that the trial took place
immediately after the deposition of the Four Hundred (sects. 14,
24). He was heavily fined, and deprived of his citizenship (sects.
15, 33, 38). It would appear that the fine was greater than his
property could discharge; accordingly this fine, remaining unpaid,
would become chargeable upon his sons after his death, and unless
they could pay it, they would come into the situation of insolvent
public debtors to the state, which would debar them from the
exercise of the rights of citizenship, so long as the debt remained
unpaid. But while Polystratus was alive, his sons were not liable
to the state for the payment of his fine; and <i>they</i> therefore
still remained citizens, and in the full exercise of their rights,
though <i>he</i> was disfranchised. They were three sons, all of whom had
served with credit as hoplites, and even as horsemen, in Sicily and
elsewhere. In the speech before us, one of them prefers a petition
to the dikastery, that the sentence passed against his father may be
mitigated; partly on the ground that it was unmerited, being passed
while his father was afraid to stand forward in his own defence,
partly as recompense for distinguished military services of all the
three sons. The speech was delivered at a time later than the battle
of Kynossêma, in the autumn of this year (sect. 31), but not very
long after the overthrow of the Four Hundred, and certainly, I think,
long before the Thirty; so that the assertion of Taylor (Vit. Lysiæ,
p. 55) that <i>all</i> the extant orations of Lysias bear date after the
Thirty, must be received with this exception.</p>

<p id="Footnote_147"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_147">[147]</a></span> Thucyd. viii, 101. The latter
portion of this voyage is sufficiently distinct; the earlier portion
less so. I describe it in the text differently from all the best
and most recent editors of Thucydidês; from whom I dissent with the
less reluctance, as they all here take the gravest liberty with his
text, inserting the negative οὐ <i>on pure conjecture</i>, without the
authority of a single MS. Niebuhr has laid it down as almost a canon
of criticism that this is never to be done: yet here we have Krüger
recommending it, and Haack, Göller, Dr. Arnold, Poppo, and M. Didot,
all adopting it as a part of the text of Thucydidês; without even
following the caution of Bekker in his small edition, who admonishes
the reader, by inclosing the word in brackets. Nay, Dr. Arnold goes
so far as to say in note, “<i>This correction is so certain and so
necessary, that it only shows the inattention of the earlier editors
that it was not made long since.</i>”</p>

<p>The words of Thucydidês, <i>without</i> this correction, and as they
stood universally before Haack’s edition (even in Bekker’s edition of
1821), are:—</p>

<p>Ὁ δὲ Μίνδαρος ἐν τούτῳ καὶ αἱ ἐκ τῆς Χίου τῶν Πελοποννησίων
νῆες ἐπισιτισάμεναι δυσῖν ἡμέραις, καὶ λαβόντες παρὰ τῶν Χίων
τρεῖς τεσσαρακοστὰς ἕκαστος Χίας τῇ τρίτῃ διὰ ταχέων <em
class="gesperrt">ἀπαίρουσιν ἐκ τῆς Χίου πελάγιαι, ἵνα μὴ περιτύχωσι
ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἐρέσῳ ναυσίν, ἀλλὰ ἐν ἀριστερᾷ τὴν Λέσβον ἔχοντες ἔπλεον
ἐπὶ τὴν ἤπειρον</em>. Καὶ προσβαλόντες τῆς Φωκαΐδος ἐς τὸν ἐν
Καρτερίοις λιμένα, καὶ ἀριστοποιησάμενοι, παραπλεύσαντες τὴν Κυμαίαν
δειπνοποιοῦνται ἐν Ἀργενούσαις τῆς ἠπείρου, ἐν τῷ ἀντιπέρας τῆς
Μιτυλήνης, etc.</p>

<p>Haack and the other eminent critics just mentioned, all insist
that these words as they stand are absurd and contradictory, and
that it is indispensable to insert οὐ before πελάγιαι; so that the
sentence stands in their editions <em class="gesperrt">ἀπαίρουσιν ἐκ
τῆς Χίου οὐ πελάγιαι</em>. They all picture to themselves the fleet
of Mindarus as sailing from the town of Chios <i>northward</i>, and going
out at the northern strait. Admitting this, they say, plausibly
enough, that the words of the old text involve a contradiction,
because Mindarus would be going in the direction towards Eresus, and
not away from it; though even then, the propriety of their correction
would be disputable. But the word πελάγιος, when applied to ships
departing from Chios,—though it may perhaps mean that they round
the northeastern corner of the island and then strike west round
Lesbos,—yet means also as naturally, and more naturally, to announce
them as <i>departing by the outer sea</i>, or sailing <i>on the sea-side</i>
(round the southern and western coast) <i>of the island</i>. Accept <i>this
meaning</i>, and the old words construe perfectly well. Ἀπαίρειν ἐκ τῆς
Χίου πελάγιος is the natural and proper phrase for describing the
circuit of Mindarus round the south and west coast of Chios. This,
too, was the only way by which he could have escaped the scouts and
the ships of Thrasyllus: for which same purpose of avoiding Athenian
ships, we find (viii, 80) the squadron of Klearchus, on another
occasion, making a long circuit out to sea. If it be supposed, which
those who read <em class="gesperrt">οὐ</em> πελάγιαι must suppose,
that Mindarus sailed first up the northern strait between Chios
and the mainland, and then turned his course east towards Phokæa,
this would have been the course which Thrasyllus expected that he
would take; and it is hardly possible to explain why he was not seen
both by the Athenian scouts as well as by the Athenian garrison at
their station of Delphinium on Chios itself. Whereas, by taking the
circuitous route round the southern and western coast, he never came
in sight either of one or the other: and he was enabled, when he got
round to the latitude north of the island, to turn to the right and
take a straight easterly course, <i>with Lesbos on his left hand</i>, but
at a sufficient distance from land to be out of sight of all scouts.
Ἀνάγεσθαι ἐκ τῆς Χίου πελάγιος (Xen. Hellen. ii, 1, 17), means to
strike into the open sea, quite clear of the coast of Asia: that
passage does not decisively indicate whether the ships rounded the
southeast or the northeast corner of the island.</p>

<p>We are here told that the seamen of Mindarus received from the
Chians per head <i>three Chian tessarakostæ</i>. Now this is a small Chian
coin, nowhere else mentioned; and it is surprising to find so petty
and local a denomination of money here specified by Thucydidês,
contrasted with the different manner in which Xenophon describes
Chian payments to the Peloponnesian seamen (Hellen. i, 6, 12; ii, 1,
5). But the voyage of Mindarus round the south and west of the island
explains the circumstance. He must have landed twice on the island
during this circumnavigation (perhaps starting in the evening),
for dinner and supper: and this Chian coin, which probably had no
circulation out of the island, served each man to buy provisions at
the Chian landing-places. It was not convenient to Mindarus to take
aboard <i>more</i> provisions in kind, at the town of Chios; because he
had already aboard a stock of provisions for two days, the subsequent
portion of his voyage, along the coast of Asia to Sigeium, during
which he could not afford time to halt and buy them, and where indeed
the territory was not friendly.</p>

<p>It is enough if I can show that the old text of Thucydidês will
construe very well, without the violent intrusion of this conjectural
<em class="gesperrt">οὐ</em>. But I can show more: for this negative
actually renders even the construction of the sentence awkward at
least, if not inadmissible. Surely, ἀπαίρουσιν οὐ πελάγιαι, ἀλλὰ,
ought to be followed by a correlative adjective or participle
belonging to the same verb ἀπαίρουσιν: yet if we take ἔχοντες as such
correlative participle, how are we to construe ἔπλεον? In order to
express the sense which Haack brings out, we ought surely to have
different words, such as: οὐκ ἄπῃραν ἐκ τῆς Χίου πελάγιαι, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν
ἀριστέρᾳ τὴν Λέσβον ἔχοντες ἔπλεον ἐπὶ τὴν ἤπειρον. Even the change
of tense from present to past, when we follow the construction of
Haack, is awkward; while if we understand the words in the sense
which I propose, the change of tense is perfectly admissible, since
the two verbs do not both refer to the same movement or to the same
portion of the voyage. “<i>The fleet starts from Chios out by the
sea-side of the island; but when it came to have Lesbos on the left
hand, it sailed straight to the continent.</i>”</p>

<p>I hope that I am not too late to make good my γραφὴν ξενίας, or
protest, against the unwarranted right of Thucydidean citizenship
which the recent editors have conferred upon this word <em
class="gesperrt">οὐ</em>, in c. 101. The old text ought certainly to
be restored; or, if these editors maintain their views, they ought at
least to inclose the word in brackets. In the edition of Thucydidês,
published at Leipsic, 1845, by C. A. Koth, I observe that the text is
still correctly printed, without the negative.</p>

προειρημένης φυλακῆς τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ, ὅπως αὐτῶν ἀνακῶς ἕξουσιν, ἢν
ἐκπλέωσι</em>· τὰς δὲ μετὰ τοῦ Μινδάρου ἅμα ἕῳ κατιδόντες, etc.</p>

<p>Here, again, we have a difficult text, which has much perplexed
the commentators, and which I venture to translate, as it stands
in my text, differently from all of them. The words, προειρημένης
φυλακῆς τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ, ὅπως αὐτῶν ἀνακῶς ἕξουσιν, ἢν ἐκπλέωσι, are
explained by the Scholiast to mean: “Although watch had been enjoined
to them (i.e. to the Peloponnesian guard-squadron at Abydos) by the
friendly approaching fleet (of Mindarus), that they should keep
strict guard on the Athenians at Sestos, in case the latter should
sail out.”</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold, Göller, Poppo, and M. Didot, all accept this
construction, though all agree that it is most harsh and confused.
The former says: “This again is most strangely intended to mean,
προειρημένου αὐτοῖς <em class="gesperrt">ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιπλεόντων
φίλων</em> φυλάσσειν τοὺς πολεμίους.”</p>

<p>To construe τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ as equivalent to ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιπλεόντων
φίλων, is certainly such a harshness as we ought to be very glad
to escape. And the construction of the Scholiast involves another
liberty which I cannot but consider as objectionable. He supplies,
in his paraphrase, the word <em class="gesperrt">καίτοι</em>,
<i>although</i>, from his own imagination. There is no indication of
<i>although</i>, either express or implied, in the text of Thucydidês;
and it appears to me hazardous to assume into the meaning so
decisive a particle without any authority. The genitive absolute,
when annexed to the main predication affirmed in the verb, usually
denotes something naturally connected with it in the way of cause,
concomitancy, explanation, or modification, not something opposed
to it, requiring to be prefaced by an <i>although</i>; if this latter
be intended, then the word <i>although</i> is expressed, not left to
be understood. After Thucydidês has told us that the Athenians at
Sestos escaped their opposite enemies at Abydos, when he next goes
on to add something under the genitive absolute, we expect that it
should be a new fact which explains why or how they escaped: but
if the new fact which he tells us, far from explaining the escape,
renders it more extraordinary (such as, that the Peloponnesians
had received strict orders to watch them), he would surely prepare
the reader for this new fact by an express particle, such as
<i>although</i> or <i>notwithstanding</i>: “The Athenians escaped, <i>although</i>
the Peloponnesians had received the strictest orders to watch them
and block them up.” As nothing equivalent to, or implying, the
adversative particle <i>although</i> is to be found in the Greek words, so
I infer, as a high probability, that it is not to be sought in the
meaning.</p>

<p>Differing from the commentators, I think that these words,
προειρημένης φυλακῆς τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ, ὅπως αὐτῶν ἀνακῶς ἕξουσιν,
ἢν ἐκπλέωσι, <i>do</i> assign the reason for the fact which had been
immediately before announced, and which was really extraordinary;
namely, that the Athenian squadron was allowed to pass by Abydos, and
escape from Sestos to Elæûs. That reason was, that the Peloponnesian
guard-squadron had before received special orders from Mindarus,
<i>to concentrate its attention and watchfulness upon his approaching
squadron</i>; hence it arose that they left the Athenians at Sestos
unnoticed.</p>

<p>The words τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ are equivalent to τῷ τῶν φίλων ἐπίπλῳ,
and the pronoun <em class="gesperrt">αὐτῶν</em>, which immediately
follows, refers to <em class="gesperrt">φίλων</em> (<i>the approaching
fleet of Mindarus</i>), not to the Athenians at Sestos, as the Scholiast
and the commentators construe it. This mistake about the reference of
αὐτῶν seems to me to have put them all wrong.</p>

<p>That τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ must be construed as equivalent to τῷ
τῶν φίλων ἐπίπλῳ is certain; but it is not equivalent to ὑπὸ τῶν
ἐπιπλεόντων φίλων; nor is it possible to construe the words as
the Scholiast would understand them: “<i>orders had been previously
given by the approach (or arrival) of their friends</i>;” whereby we
should turn ὁ ἐπίπλους into an acting and commanding personality.
The “approach of their friends” is an event, which may properly be
said “to have produced an effect,” but which cannot be said “to have
given previous orders.” It appears to me that τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ is the
dative case, governed by φυλακῆς; “<i>a look-out for the arrival of
the Peloponnesians</i>,” having been enjoined upon these guardships at
Abydos: “<i>They had been ordered to watch for the approaching voyage
of their friends.</i>” The English preposition <i>for</i>, expresses here
exactly the sense of the Greek dative; that is, the <i>object, purpose,
or persons whose benefit is referred to</i>.</p>

<p>The words immediately succeeding, ὅπως αὐτῶν (τῶν φίλων) ἀνακῶς
ἕξουσιν, ἢν ἐκπλέωσι, are an expansion of consequences intended
to follow from φυλακῆς τῷ φιλίῳ ἐπίπλῳ. “They shall watch for the
approach of the main fleet, in order that they may devote special
and paramount regard to its safety, in case it makes a start.”
For the phrase ἀνακῶς ἔχειν, compare Herodot. i, 24; viii, 109.
Plutarch, Theseus, c. 33: <em class="gesperrt">ἀνακῶς</em>, φυλακτῶς,
προνοητικῶς, ἐπιμελῶς, the notes of Arnold and Göller here; and
Kühner, Gr. Gr. sect. 533, ἀνακῶς ἔχειν τινός, for ἐπιμελεῖσθαι. The
words ἀνακῶς ἔχειν express the anxious and special vigilance which
the Peloponnesian squadron at Abydos was directed to keep for the
arrival of Mindarus and his fleet, which was a matter of doubt and
danger: but they would not be properly applicable to the duty of that
squadron as respects the opposite Athenian squadron at Sestos, which
was hardly of superior force to themselves, and was besides an avowed
enemy, in sight of their own port.</p>

<p>Lastly, the words ἢν ἐκπλέωσι refer <i>to Mindarus and his fleet
about to start from Chios, as their subject</i>, not to the Athenians at
Sestos.</p>

<p>The whole sentence would stand thus, if we dismiss the
peculiarities of Thucydidês, and express the meaning in common Greek:
Καὶ τὰς μὲν ἐν Ἀβύδῳ ἑκκαίδεκα ναῦς (Ἀθηναῖοι) ἔλαθον· προείρητο γὰρ
(ἐκείναις ταῖς ναῦσιν) φυλάσσειν τὸν ἐπίπλουν τῶν φίλων, ὅπως <em
class="gesperrt">αὐτῶν</em> (τῶν φίλων) ἀνακῶς ἔξουσιν, ἢν ἐκπλέωσι.
The verb φυλάσσειν here, and of course the abstract substantive
φυλακὴ which represents it, signifies to <i>watch</i> for, or <i>wait</i> for:
like Thucyd. ii, 3. φυλάξαντες ἔτι νύκτα, καὶ αὐτὸ τὸ περίορθρον;
also viii, 41, ἐφύλασσε.</p>

<p>If we construe the words in this way, they will appear in perfect
harmony with the general scheme and purpose of Mindarus. That admiral
is bent upon carrying his fleet to the Hellespont, but to avoid an
action with Thrasyllus in doing so. This is difficult to accomplish,
and can only be done by great secrecy of proceeding, as well as by an
unusual route. He sends orders beforehand from Chios, perhaps even
from Milêtus, before he quitted that place, to the Peloponnesian
squadron guarding the Hellespont at Abydos. He contemplates the
possible case that Thrasyllus may detect his plan, intercept him on
the passage, and perhaps block him up or compel him to fight in some
roadstead or bay on the coast opposite Lesbos, or on the Troad, which
would indeed have come to pass, had he been seen by a single hostile
fishing-boat in rounding the island of Chios. Now the orders sent
forward, direct the Peloponnesian squadron at Abydos what they are
to do in this contingency; since without such orders, the captain
of the squadron would not have known what to do, assuming Mindarus
to be intercepted by Thrasyllus; whether to remain on guard at the
Hellespont, which was his special duty; or to leave the Hellespont
unguarded, keep his attention concentrated on Mindarus, and come
forth to help him. “Let your first thought be to insure the safe
arrival of the main fleet at the Hellespont, and to come out and
render help to it, if it be attacked in its route; even though it
be necessary for that purpose to leave the Hellespont for a time
unguarded.” Mindarus could not tell beforehand the exact moment when
he would start from Chios, nor was it, indeed, absolutely certain
that he would start at all, if the enemy were watching him: his
orders were therefore sent, <i>conditional</i> upon his being able to get
off (<em class="gesperrt">ἢν ἐκπλέωσι</em>). But he was lucky enough,
by the well-laid plan of his voyage, to get to the Hellespont without
encountering an enemy. The Peloponnesian squadron at Abydos, however,
having received his special orders, when the fire-signals acquainted
them that he was approaching, thought only of keeping themselves in
reserve to lend him assistance if he needed it, and neglected the
Athenians opposite. As it was night, probably the best thing which
they could do, was to wait in Abydos for daylight, until they could
learn particulars of his position, and how or where they could render
aid.</p>

<p>We thus see both the general purpose of Mindarus, and in what
manner the orders which he had transmitted to the Peloponnesian
squadron at Abydos, brought about indirectly the escape of the
Athenian squadron without interruption from Sestos.</p>

<p>The general account which Diodorus gives of this battle, is, even

It is vain to try to blend them. I have been able to borrow from

the Athenian pilots and the Peloponnesian epibatæ. He states that
twenty-five fresh ships arrived to join the Athenians in the middle

was read and copied by Ephorus. By an exaggerated and over-literal
confidence in the words of it, Diodorus is led to affirm that these
twelve men were the only persons saved, and that every other person
perished. But we know perfectly that Hippokratês himself survived,
and that he was alive at the subsequent battle of Kyzikus (Xenoph.
Hellen. i, 1, 23).</p>

this event a year later, but I agree with Sievers in conceiving it as
following with little delay on the withdrawal of the protecting fleet
(Sievers, Comment. in Xenoph. Hellen. p. 9; note, p. 66).</p>

<p>I cannot make out from Colonel Leake what is the exact breadth
of the channel. Strabo talks in his time of a bridge reaching
two hundred feet (x, p. 400). But there must have been material
alterations made by the inhabitants of Chalkis during the time of
Alexander the Great (Strabo, x, p. 447). The bridge here described
by Diodorus, covering an open space broad enough for one ship, could
scarcely have been more than twenty feet broad; for it was not at
all designed to render the passage easy. The ancient ships could all
lower their masts. I cannot but think that Colonel Leake (p. 259)
must have read, in Diodorus, xiii, 47, οὐ in place of ὁ.</p>

<p id="Footnote_158"><span class="label"><a

at this point that we have to part company with the historian
Thucydidês, whose work not only closes without reaching any definite
epoch or limit, but even breaks off, as we possess it, in the middle
of a sentence.</p>

<p>The full extent of this irreparable loss can hardly be conceived,
except by those who have been called upon to study his work with the
profound and minute attention required from an historian of Greece.
To pass from Thucydidês to the Hellenica of Xenophon, is a descent
truly mournful; and yet, when we look at Grecian history as a whole,
we have great reason to rejoice that even so inferior a work as the
latter has reached us. The historical purposes and conceptions of
Thucydidês, as set forth by himself in his preface, are exalted and
philosophical to a degree altogether wonderful, when we consider
that he had no preëxisting models before him from which to derive
them; nor are the eight books of his work, in spite of the unfinished
condition of the last, unworthy of these large promises, either in
spirit or in execution. Even the peculiarity, the condensation, and
the harshness, of his style, though it sometimes hides from us his
full meaning, has the general effect of lending great additional
force and of impressing his thoughts much more deeply upon every
attentive reader.</p>

<p>During the course of my two last volumes, I have had frequent
occasion to notice the criticisms of Dr. Arnold in his edition of
Thucydidês, most generally on points where I dissented from him. I
have done this, partly because I believe that Dr. Arnold’s edition
is in most frequent use among all English readers of Thucydidês,
partly because of the high esteem which I entertain for the liberal
spirit, the erudition, and the judgment, which pervade his criticisms
generally throughout the book. Dr. Arnold deserves, especially,
the high commendation, not often to be bestowed even upon learned
and exact commentators, of conceiving and appreciating antiquity
as a living whole, and not merely as an aggregate of words and
abstractions. His criticisms are continually adopted by Göller in
the second edition of his Thucydidês, and to a great degree also
by Poppo. Desiring, as I do sincerely, that his edition may long
maintain its preëminence among English students of Thucydidês, I have
thought it my duty at the same time to indicate many of the points on
which his remarks either advance or imply views of Grecian history
different from my own.</p>

Xenophon distinguishes these twenty-five Syracusan triremes into τῶν

But it appears to me that the twenty triremes, as well as the five,
must have come to Asia since the battle of Kyzikus, though the five
may have been somewhat later in their period of arrival. All the
Syracusan ships in the fleet of Mindarus were destroyed; and it
seems impossible to imagine that that admiral can have left twenty
Syracusan ships at Ephesus or Milêtus in addition to those which he
took with him to the Hellespont.</p>

<p>This passage strengthens the doubts which I threw out in a former
chapter, whether the Athenians ever did or could realize their
project of commuting the tribute, imposed upon the dependent allies,
for an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of five per cent. on imports and exports,
which project is mentioned by Thucydidês (vii, 28) as having been
resolved upon at least, if not carried out, in the summer of 413
<small>B.C.</small> In the bargain here made with the
Chalkêdonians, it seems implied that the payment of tribute was the
last arrangement subsisting between Athens and Chalkêdon, at the time
of the revolt of the latter.</p>

<p>Next, I agree with the remark made by Schneider, in
his note upon the passage, Ἀθηναίους δὲ μὴ πολεμεῖν <em
class="gesperrt">Καλχηδονίοις</em>. He notices the tenor of the
covenant as it stands in Plutarch, τὴν Φαρναβάζου δὲ χώραν μὴ
ἀδικεῖν (Alkib. c. 31), which is certainly far more suitable to
the circumstances. Instead of Καλχηδονίοις, he proposes to read
Φαρναβάζῳ. At any rate, this is the meaning.</p>

<p>Mr. Fynes Clinton (Fast. H. ad ann. 407 <small>B.C.</small>) has,
I presume, been misled by the first words of this passage, πρότερον
τούτων οὐ πολλῷ χρόνῳ, when he says: “During the stay of Alcibiadês
at Athens, Lysander is sent as ναύαρχος, Xen. Hell. i, 5, 1. Then
followed the defeat of Antiochus, the deposition of Alcibiadês,
and the substitution of ἄλλους δέκα, between September 407 <i>and
September</i> 406, <i>when Callicratidas succeeded Lysander</i>.”</p>

<p>Now Alkibiadês came to Athens in the month of Thargelion, or
about the end of May, 407, and stayed there till the beginning of
September, 407. Cyrus arrived at Sardis before Alkibiadês reached
Athens, and Lysander had been some time at his post before Cyrus
arrived; so that Lysander was not sent out “during the stay of
Alcibiadês at Athens,” but some months before. Still less is it
correct to say that Kallikratidas succeeded Lysander in September,
406. The battle of Arginusæ, wherein Kallikratidas perished, was
fought about August, 406, after he had been admiral for several
months. The words πρότερον τούτων, when construed along with the
context which succeeds, must evidently be understood in a large
sense; “<i>these events</i>,” mean the general series of events which
begins i, 4, 8; the proceedings of Alkibiadês, from the beginning of
the spring of 407.</p>

<p>This is not strictly correct. The rate of pay is not specified in
either of the three conventions, as they stand in Thucyd. viii, 18,
37, 58. It seems to have been, from the beginning, matter of verbal
understanding and promise; first, a drachma per day was promised by
the envoys of Tissaphernês at Sparta; next, the satrap himself, at
Milêtus, cut down this drachma to half a drachma, and promised this
lower rate for the future (viii, 29).</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford says: “Lysander proposed that an Attic drachma, <i>which
was eight oboli</i>, nearly tenpence sterling, should be allowed for
daily pay to every seaman.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mitford had in the previous sentence stated <i>three oboli</i> as
equal to not quite <i>fourpence</i> sterling. Of course, therefore, it is
plain that he did not consider three oboli as the half of a drachma
(Hist. Greece, ch. xx, sect. i. vol. iv, p. 317, oct. ed. 1814).</p>

<p>That a drachma was equivalent to <i>six</i> oboli, that is, an Æginæan
drachma to six Æginæan oboli, and an Attic drachma to six Attic
oboli, is so familiarly known, that I should almost have imagined the
word <i>eight</i>, in the first sentence here cited, to be a misprint for
<i>six</i>, if the sentence cited next had not clearly demonstrated that
Mr. Mitford really believed a drachma to he equal to <i>eight</i> oboli.
It is certainly a mistake surprising to find.</p>

of Alkibiadês as having been a most uncomfortable and troublesome
companion (sect. 7). His testimony on the point is valuable; for
there seems no disposition here to make out any case against
Alkibiadês. The trierarch notices the fact, that Alkibiadês preferred

Athenians), οὐ διὰ μακροῦ ἔσφηλαν τὴν πόλιν.</p>

<p>The “strenuous and effective prosecution of warlike
business” here ascribed to Alkibiadês, is true of all the
period between his exile and his last visit to Athens (about
September <small>B.C.</small> 415 to September <small>B.C.</small> 407). During the first four years of that
time, he was very effective against Athens; during the last four,
very effective in her service.</p>

<p>But the assertion is certainly not true of his last command, which
ended with the battle of Notium; nor is it more than partially true,
at least, it is an exaggeration of the truth, for the period before
his exile.</p>

the tributes from Cyrus which he had in his possession, instead of
giving them back to Cyrus (Xenoph. Hellen. ii, 3, 8). This obligation
to give them back to Cyrus was greater at the end of the war than it
was at the time when Kallikratidas came out, and when war was still

<p>Here, as on so many other occasions, it is impossible to blend
these two narratives together. Diodorus conceives the facts in a
manner quite different from Xenophon, and much less probable. He
tells us that Konon practised a stratagem during his flight (the
same in Polyænus, i, 482), whereby he was enabled to fight with and
defeat the foremost Peloponnesian ships before the rest came up:
also, that he got into the harbor in time to put it into a state of
defence before Kallikratidas came up. Diodorus then gives a prolix
description of the battle by which Kallikratidas forced his way
in.</p>

<p>The narrative of Xenophon, which I have followed, plainly implies
that Konon could have had no time to make preparations for defending
the harbor.</p>

Xenophon talks only of <i>the</i> harbor, as if it were <i>one</i>; and
possibly, in very inaccurate language, it might be described as one
harbor with two entrances. It seems to me, however, that Xenophon had
no clear idea of the locality.</p>

<p>Strabo speaks of the northern harbor as defended by a
mole, the southern harbor, as defended by triremes chained
together. Such defences did not exist in the year 406 <small>B.C.</small> Probably, after the revolt of Mitylênê in
427 <small>B.C.</small>, the Athenians had removed what
defences might have been before provided for the harbor.</p>

<p>The meaning of παραῤῥύματα is very uncertain. The commentators
give little instruction; nor can we be sure that the same thing is
meant as is expressed by παραβλήματα (<i>infra</i>, ii, 1, 22). We may
be quite sure that the matters meant by παραῤῥύματα were something
which, if visible at all to a spectator without, would at least
afford no indication that the trireme was intended for a speedy
start; otherwise, they would defeat the whole contrivance of Konon,
whose aim was secrecy. It was essential that this trireme, though
afloat, should be made to look as much as possible like to the other
triremes which still remained hauled ashore; in order that the
Peloponnesians might not suspect any purpose of departure. I have

(xiii, 100, 101, 102), where nothing is mentioned except about
picking up the floating <i>dead</i> bodies; about the crime, and offence
in the eyes of the people, of omitting to secure burial to so many
<i>dead</i> bodies. He does not seem to have fancied that there were any
<i>living bodies</i>, or that it was a question between life and death to
so many of the crews. Whereas, if we follow the narrative of Xenophon
(Hellen. i, 7), we shall see that the question is put throughout
about picking up the <i>living men</i>, the <i>shipwrecked men</i>, or the men
belonging to, and still living aboard of, the broken ships, ἀνελέσθαι
τοὺς ναυαγοὺς, τοὺς δυστυχοῦντας, τοὺς καταδύντας (Hellen. ii, 3,
32): compare, especially, ii, 3, 35, πλεῖν ἐπὶ τὰς καταδεδυκυίας
ναῦς καὶ τοὺς ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν ἀνθρώπους (i, 6, 36). The word ναυαγὸς
does not mean a dead body, but a <i>living man</i> who has suffered
shipwreck: <em class="gesperrt">Ναυαγὸς</em> ἥκω, ξένος, ἀσύλητον
γένος (says Menelaus, Eurip. Helen. 457); also 407, Καὶ νῦν τάλας <em
class="gesperrt">ναυαγὸς</em>, ἀπολέσας φίλους Ἐξέπεσον ἐς γῆν τήνδε
etc.; again, 538. It corresponds with the Latin <i>naufragus</i>: “mersâ
rate naufragus assem Dum rogat, et pictâ se tempestate tuetur,”
(Juvenal, xiv, 301.) Thucydidês does not use the word ναυαγοὺς, but
speaks of τοὺς νεκροὺς καὶ τὰ ναυαγία, meaning by the latter word the
damaged ships, with every person and thing on board.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Schneider and most other commentators on
Xenophon, Sturz in his Lexicon Xenophonteum (v. ἀναίρεσις), Stallbaum
ad Platon. Apol. Socrat. c. 20, p. 32, Sievers, Comment. ad Xenoph.
Hellen. p. 31, Forchhammer, Die Athener und Sokratês, pp. 30-31,
Berlin, 1837, and others, all treat this event as if it were nothing
but a question of picking up dead bodies for sepulture. This is a
complete misinterpretation of Xenophon; not merely because the word
ναυαγὸς, which he uses four several times, means <i>a living person</i>,
but because there are two other passages, which leave absolutely no
doubt about the matter: Παρῆλθε δὲ τις ἐς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, φάσκων ἐπὶ
τεύχους ἀλφίτων σωθῆναι· <em class="gesperrt">ἐπιστέλλειν δ᾽ αὐτῷ
τοὺς ἀπολλυμένους, ἐὰν σωθῂ, ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ δήμῳ, ὅτι οἱ στρατηγοὶ οὐκ
ἀνείλοντο τοὺς ἀρίστους ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος γενομένους</em>. Again (ii,
3, 35), Theramenês, when vindicating himself before the oligarchy
of Thirty, two years afterwards, for his conduct in accusing the
generals, says that the generals brought their own destruction upon
themselves by accusing him first, and by saying that the men on the
disabled ships might have been saved with proper diligence: φάσκοντες
γὰρ (the generals) <em class="gesperrt">οἷον τε εἶναι σῶσαι τοὺς
ἄνδρας, προέμενοι αὐτοὺς ἀπολέσθαι</em>, ἀποπλέοντες ᾤχοντο. These
passages place the point beyond dispute, that the generals were
accused of having neglected to save the lives of men on the point
of being drowned, and who by their neglect afterwards were drowned,
not of having neglected to pick up dead bodies for sepulture. The
misinterpretation of the commentators is here of the gravest import.
It alters completely the criticisms on the proceedings at Athens.</p>

<p>Schneider in his note, and Mr. Mitford in his History, express
surprise at the discrepancy between the number <i>twelve</i>, which
appears in the speech of Euryptolemus, and the number <i>twenty-five</i>,
given by Xenophon.</p>

<p>But, first, we are not to suppose Xenophon to guarantee those
assertions, as to matters of fact which he gives, as coming from
Euryptolemus; who as an advocate, speaking in the assembly, might
take great liberties with the truth.</p>

<p>Next, Xenophon speaks of the total number of ships ruined or
disabled in the action: Euryptolemus speaks of the total number
of wrecks afloat and capable of being visited so as to rescue the
sufferers, <i>at the subsequent moment</i>, when the generals directed
the squadron under Theramenês to go out for the rescue. It is to be
remembered that the generals went back to Arginusæ from the battle,
and there determined, according to their own statement, to send out
from thence a squadron for visiting the wrecks. A certain interval
of time must therefore have elapsed between the close of the action
and the order given to Theramenês. During that interval, undoubtedly,
<i>some</i> of the disabled ships went down, or came to pieces: if we are
to believe Euryptolemus, thirteen out of the twenty-five must have
thus disappeared, so that their crews were already drowned, and no
more than twelve remained floating for Theramenês to visit, even had
he been ever so active and ever so much favored by weather.</p>

<p>I distrust the statement of Euryptolemus, and believe that he
most probably underrated the number. But assuming him to be correct,
this will only show how much the generals were to blame, as we shall
hereafter remark, for not having seen to the visitation of the wrecks
<i>before</i> they went back to their moorings at Arginusæ.</p>

Archedêmus is described as τῆς Δεκελείας ἐπιμελούμενος. What is
meant by these words, none of the commentators can explain in a
satisfactory manner. The text must be corrupt. Some conjecture like
that of Dobree seems plausible; some word like τῆς δεκάτης or τῆς
δεκατεύσεως, having reference to the levying of the tithe in the
Hellespont; which would furnish reasonable ground for the proceeding
of Archedêmus against Erasinidês.</p>

<p>The office held by Archedêmus, whatever it was, must have been
sufficiently exalted to confer upon him the power of imposing the
fine of limited amount called ἐπιβολή.</p>

<p>I hesitate to identify this Archedêmus with the person of that
name mentioned in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, ii, 9. There seems no
similarity at all in the points of character noticed.</p>

<p>The popular orator Archedêmus was derided by Eupolis and
Aristophanês as having sore eyes, and as having got his citizenship
without a proper title to it (see Aristophan. Ran. 419-588, with the
Scholia). He is also charged, in a line of an oration of Lysias, with
having embezzled the public money (Lysias cont. Alkibiad. sect. 25,

μετέπεισαν placing a comma after ξυνάρχοντας. This is unusual, but
not inadmissible. To persuade a man to alter his opinion or his

Theramenês really did say, in the actual discussions at Athens on the
conduct of the generals, that which he here asserts himself to have
said, namely, that the violence of the storm rendered it impossible
for any one to put to sea, his accusation against the generals must
have been grounded upon alleging that they might have performed the
duty at an earlier moment; before they came back from the battle;
before the storm arose; before they gave the order to him. But I
think it most probable that he misrepresented at the later period
what he had said at the earlier, and that he did not, during the
actual discussions, admit the sufficiency of the storm as fact and
justification.</p>

board half her crew, or one hundred men, after the action; not more
than half would have been slain or drowned in the combat. Even ten
disabled ships would thus contain one thousand living men, wounded
and unwounded. It will be seen, therefore, that I have understated

any military movement after their last maritime victory in the
Great Harbor, when they were full of triumph, felicitation, and

<p>They had visited the wrecks and picked up both the living men
on board and the floating bodies <i>before</i> they went ashore. It is
remarkable that the Athenians on that occasion were so completely
overpowered by the immensity of their disaster, that they never even
thought of asking permission, always granted by the victors when
asked, to pick up their dead or visit their wrecks (viii, 72).</p>

light in which I here place the conduct of Theramenês is not only
coincident with Diodorus, but with the representations of Kritias,
the violent enemy of Theramenês under the government of the Thirty,
just before he was going to put Theramenês to death: Οὗτος δέ τοι
ἐστὶν, ὃς ταχθεὶς ἀνελέσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν στρατηγῶν τοὺς καταδύντας
Ἀθηναίων ἐν τῇ περὶ Λέσβον ναυμαχίᾳ, <em class="gesperrt">αὐτὸς οὐκ
ἀνελόμενος</em> ὅμως τῶν στρατηγῶν κατηγορῶν ἀπέκτεινεν αὐτοὺς, <em
class="gesperrt">ἵνα αὐτὸς περισωθείη</em>. (Xen. ut sup.)</p>

<p>Here it stands admitted that the first impression at Athens was,
as Diodorus states expressly, that Theramenês was ordered to pick
up the men on the wrecks, might have done it if he had taken proper
pains, and was to blame for not doing it. Now how did this impression
arise? Of course, through communications received from the armament
itself. And when Theramenês, in his reply, says that the generals
themselves made communications in the same tenor, there is no reason
why we should not believe him, in spite of their joint official
despatch, wherein they made no mention of him, and in spite of their
speech in the public assembly afterwards, where the previous official
letter fettered them, and prevented them from accusing him, forcing
them to adhere to the statement first made, of the all-sufficiency of
the storm.</p>

<p>The main facts which we here find established, even by the enemies
of Theramenês, are: 1. That Theramenês accused the generals because
he found himself in danger of being punished for the neglect. 2. That
his enemies, who charged him with the breach of duty, did not admit
the storm as an excuse for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>One sees, by the expression used by Xenophon respecting the

direction favorable to carry the fleet of Eteonikus to Chios. Konon
was under no particular motive to go out immediately: he could afford
to wait until the wind became quite calm. The important fact is,
that wind and weather were perfectly compatible with, indeed even
favorable to, the escape of the Peloponnesian fleet from Mitylênê to

περὶ τὸν Θηραμένην παρεσκεύασαν ἀνθρώπους <em class="gesperrt">μέλανα
ἱμάτια ἔχοντας, καὶ ἐν χρῷ κεκαρμένους πολλοὺς ἐν ταύτῃ τῇ

ξυγγενεῖς ὄντες τῶν ἀπολωλότων</em>.</p>

<p>Here I adopt substantially the statement of Diodorus, who gives a
juster and more natural description of the proceeding; representing
it as a spontaneous action of mournful and vindictive feeling on the
part of the kinsmen of the deceased (xiii, 101).</p>

<p>Other historians of Greece, Dr. Thirlwall not excepted (Hist.
of Greece, ch. xxx, vol. iv, pp. 117-125), follow Xenophon on this
point. They treat the intense sentiment against the generals at
Athens as “popular prejudices;” “excitement produced by the artifices
of Theramenês,” (Dr. Thirlwall, pp. 117-124.) “Theramenês (he says)
hired a great number of persons to attend the festival, dressed in
black, and with their heads shaven, as mourning for kinsmen whom they
had lost in the sea-fight.”</p>

<p>Yet Dr. Thirlwall speaks of the narrative of Xenophon in the most
unfavorable terms; and certainly in terms no worse than it deserves
(see p. 116, the note): “It looks as if Xenophon had <i>purposely
involved the whole affair in obscurity</i>.” Compare also p. 123, where
his criticism is equally severe.</p>

<p>I have little scruple in deserting the narrative of Xenophon,
of which I think as meanly as Dr. Thirlwall, so far as to supply,
without contradicting any of his main allegations, an omission which
I consider capital and preponderant. I accept his account of what
actually passed at the festival of the Apaturia, but I deny his
statement of the manœuvres of Theramenês as the producing cause.</p>

<p>Most of the obscurity which surrounds these proceedings at Athens
arises from the fact, that no notice has been taken of the intense
and spontaneous emotion which the desertion of the men on the wrecks
was naturally calculated to produce on the public mind. It would, in
my judgment, have been unaccountable if such an effect had not been
produced, quite apart from all instigations of Theramenês. The moment
that we recognize this capital fact, the series of transactions
becomes comparatively perspicuous and explicable.</p>

<p>Dr. Thirlwall, as well as Sievers (Commentat. de Xenophontis
Hellen. pp. 25-30), suppose Theramenês to have acted in concert with
the oligarchical party, in making use of this incident to bring about
the ruin of generals odious to them, several of whom were connected
with Alkibiadês. I confess, that I see nothing to countenance this
idea: but at all events, the cause here named is only secondary, not
the grand and dominant fact of the period.</p>

<p id="Footnote_289"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_289">[289]</a></span> I cannot concur with the
opinion expressed by Dr. Thirlwall in Appendix iii. vol. iv, p. 501,
of his History, on the subject of the psephism of Kannônus. The
view which I give in the text coincides with that of the expositors
generally, from whom Dr. Thirlwall dissents.</p>

<p>The psephism of Kannônus was the only enactment at Athens which
made it illegal to vote upon the case of two accused persons at once.
This had now grown into a practice in the judicial proceedings at
Athens; so that two or more prisoners, who were ostensibly tried
under some other law, and not under the psephism of Kannônus, with
its various provisions, would yet have the benefit of this its
particular provision, namely, severance of trial.</p>

<p>In the particular case before us, Euryptolemus was thrown back to
appeal to the psephism itself; which the senate, by a proposition
unheard of at Athens, proposed to contravene. The proposition of
the senate offended against the law in several different ways. It
deprived the generals of trial before a sworn dikastery; it also
deprived them of the liberty of full defence during a measured
time: but farther, it prescribed that they should all be condemned
or absolved by one and the same vote; and, in this last respect,
it sinned against the psephism of Kannônus. Euryptolemus in his
speech, endeavoring to persuade an exasperated assembly to reject the
proposition of the senate and adopt the psephism of Kannônus as the
basis of the trial, very prudently dwells upon the severe provisions
of the psephism, and artfully slurs over what he principally aims
at, the severance of the trials, by offering his relative Periklês
to be tried <i>first</i>. The words δίχα ἕκαστον (sect. 37) appear to me
to be naturally construed with κατὰ τὸ Καννώνου ψήφισμα, as they are
by most commentators, though Dr. Thirlwall dissents from it. It is
certain that this was the capital feature of illegality, among many,
which the proposition of the senate presented, I mean the judging and
condemning all the generals by <i>one</i> vote. It was upon this point
that the amendment of Euryptolemus was taken, and that the obstinate
resistance of Sokratês turned (Plato, Apol. 20; Xenoph. Memor. i, 1,
18).</p>

<p>Farther, Dr. Thirlwall, in assigning what he believes to have
been the real tenor of the psephism of Kannônus, appears to me to
have been misled by the Scholiast in his interpretation of the
much-discussed passage of Aristophanês, Ekklezias. 1089:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="i0">Τουτὶ τὸ πρᾶγμα κατὰ τὸ Καννώνου σαφῶς</p>
<p class="i0">Ψήφισμα, βινεῖν δεῖ με διαλελημμένον,</p>
<p class="i0">Πῶς οὖν δικωπεῖν ἀμφοτέρας δυνήσομαι;</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1 ti0">Upon which Dr. Thirlwall observes, “that the
young man is comparing his plight to that of a culprit, who, under
the decree of Cannônus, was placed at the bar held by a person on
each side. In this sense the Greek Scholiast, though his words are
corrupted, clearly understood the passage.”</p>

<p>I cannot but think that the Scholiast understood the words
completely wrong. The young man in Aristophanês does not compare his
situation <i>with that of the culprit</i>, but <i>with that of the dikastery
which tried culprits</i>. The psephism of Kannônus directed that each
defendant should be tried separately: accordingly, if it happened
that two defendants were presented for trial, and were both to be
tried without a moment’s delay, the dikastery could only effect this
object by dividing itself into two halves, or portions; which was
perfectly practicable, whether often practised or not, as it was a
numerous body. By doing this, κρίνειν διαλελημμένον, it could <i>try
both the defendants at once</i>: but in no other way.</p>

<p>Now the young man in Aristophanês compares himself to the
dikastery thus circumstanced; which comparison is signified by the
pun of βινεῖν διαλελημμένον in place of κρίνειν διαλελημμένον. He
is assailed by two obtrusive and importunate customers, neither of
whom will wait until the other has been served. Accordingly he says:
“Clearly, I ought to be divided into two parts, like a dikastery
acting under the psephism of Kannônus, to deal with this matter: yet
how <i>shall</i> I be <i>able</i> to serve both at once?”</p>

<p>This I conceive to be the proper explanation of the passage in
Aristophanês; and it affords a striking confirmation of the truth
of that which is generally received as purport of the psephism of
Kannônus. The Scholiast appears to me to have puzzled himself, and to
have misled every one else.</p>

ἐπιστέλλειν δ᾽ αὐτῷ τοὺς ἀπολλυμένους, ἐὰν σωθῇ, ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ δήμῳ,
ὅτι οἱ στρατηγοὶ οὐκ ἀνείλοντο τοὺς ἀρίστους ὑπὲρ τῆς πατρίδος
γενομένους.</p>

<p>I venture to say that there is nothing in the whole compass of
ancient oratory, more full of genuine pathos and more profoundly
impressive, than this simple incident and speech; though recounted in
the most bald manner, by an unfriendly and contemptuous advocate.</p>

<p>Yet the whole effect of it is lost, because the habit is to
dismiss everything which goes to inculpate the generals, and to
justify the vehement emotion of the Athenian public, as if it was
mere stage-trick and falsehood. Dr. Thirlwall goes even beyond
Xenophon, when he says (p. 119, vol. iv): “A man was <i>brought
forward</i>, who <i>pretended</i> he had been preserved by clinging to a
meal-barrel, and that his comrades,” etc. So Mr. Mitford: “A man was
produced,” etc. (p. 347).</p>

<p>Now παρῆλθε does not mean, “<i>he was brought forward</i>:” it is a
common word employed to signify one who <i>comes forward</i> to speak
in the public assembly (see Thucyd. iii, 44, and the participle
παρελθὼν, in numerous places).</p>

<p>Next, φάσκων while it sometimes means <i>pretending</i>, sometimes
also means simply <i>affirming</i>: Xenophon does not guarantee the
matter affirmed, but neither does he pronounce it to be false. He
uses φάσκων in various cases where he himself agrees with the fact
affirmed (see Hellen. i, 7, 12; Memorab. i, 2, 29; Cyropæd. viii, 3,
41; Plato, Ap. Socr. c. 6, p. 21).</p>

<p>The people of Athens heard and fully believed this deposition;
nor do I see any reason why an historian of Greece should disbelieve
it. There is nothing in the assertion of this man which is at all
improbable; nay, more, it is plain that several such incidents
must have happened. If we take the smallest pains to expand in our
imaginations the details connected with this painfully interesting
crisis at Athens, we shall see that numerous stories of the same
affecting character must have been in circulation; doubtless many
false, but many also perfectly true.</p>

<p>I cannot think that the explanations of this passage given either
by Schömann (De Comitiis Athen. part ii, 1, p. 160, <i>seq.</i>) or by
Meier and Schömann (Der Attische Prozess, b. iii, p. 295; b. iv, p.
696) are satisfactory. The idea of Schömann, that, in consequence
of the unconquerable resistance of Sokratês, the voting upon this
question was postponed until the next day, appears to me completely
inconsistent with the account of Xenophon; and, though countenanced
by a passage in the Pseudo-Platonic dialogue called Axiochus (c.
12), altogether loose and untrustworthy. It is plain to me that
the question was put without Sokratês, and could be legally put
by the remaining prytanes, in spite of his resistance. The word
ὑπομοσία must doubtless bear a meaning somewhat different here to its
technical sense before the dikastery; and different also, I think,
to the other sense which Meier and Schömann ascribe to it, of <i>a
formal engagement to prefer at some future time an indictment, or</i>
<em class="gesperrt">γραφὴ παρανόμων</em>. It seems to me here to
denote, an <i>objection taken on formal grounds, and sustained by oath
either tendered or actually taken, to the decision of the prytanes</i>,
or presidents. These latter had to declare on which side the show of
hands in the assembly preponderated: but there surely must have been
<i>some</i> power of calling in question their decision, if they declared
falsely, or if they put the question in a treacherous, perplexing, or
obscure manner. The Athenian assembly did not admit of an appeal to
a division, like the Spartan assembly or like the English House of
Commons; though there were many cases in which the votes at Athens
were taken by pebbles in an urn, and not by show of hands.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that Meneklês here exercised the privilege of
calling in question the decision of the prytanes, and constraining
them to take the vote over again. He may have alleged that they did
not make it clearly understood which of the two propositions was to
be put to the vote first; that they put the proposition of Kallixenus
first, without giving due notice; or perhaps that they misreported
the numbers. By what followed, we see that he had good grounds for
his objection.</p>

to these two component elements of the majority, I doubt not that
the statement of Diodorus is correct. But he represents, quite
erroneously, that the generals were condemned by the vote of the
assembly, and led off from the assembly to execution. The assembly
only decreed that the subsequent urn-voting should take place, the
result of which was necessarily uncertain beforehand. Accordingly,
the speech which Diodorus represents Diomedon to have made in the
assembly, after the vote of the assembly had been declared, cannot be
true history: “Athenians, I wish that the vote which you have just
passed may prove beneficial to the city. Do you take care to fulfil
those vows to Zeus Soter, Apollo, and the Venerable Goddesses, under
which we gained our victory since fortune has prevented us from
fulfilling them ourselves.” It is impossible that Diomedon can have
made a speech of this nature, since he was not then a condemned man;
and after the condemnatory vote, no assembly was held.</p>

(iii, 82), he is led to dwell chiefly on the latter, the antipathies
of faction, of narrow political brotherhood or conspiracy for the
attainment and maintenance of power, as most powerful in generating
evil deeds: had he described the proceedings after the battle of

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_306"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_306">[306]</a></span> The statement rests on the
authority of Aristotle, as referred to by the Scholiast on the last
verse of the Ranæ of Aristophanês. And this, so far as I know, is the
only authority: for when Mr. Fynes Clinton (Fast. Hellen. ad ann.
406) says that Æschinês (De Fals. Legat. p. 38, c. 24) mentions the
overtures of peace, I think that no one who looks at that passage
will be inclined to found any inference upon it.</p>

<p>Against it, we may observe:—</p>

<p>1. Xenophon does not mention it. This is something, though far
from being conclusive when standing alone.</p>

<p>2. Diodorus does not mention it.</p>

<p>3. The terms alleged to have been proposed by the Lacedæmonians,
are exactly the same as those said to have been proposed by them
after the death of Mindarus at Kyzikus, namely:—</p>

<p>To evacuate Dekeleia, and each party to stand as they were. Not
only the terms are the same, but also the person who stood prominent
in opposition is in both cases the same, <i>Kleophon</i>. The overtures
after Arginusæ are in fact a second edition of those after the battle
of Kyzikus.</p>

<p>Now, the supposition that on two several occasions the
Lacedæmonians made propositions of peace, and that both are left
unnoticed by Xenophon, appears to me highly improbable. In reference
to the propositions after the battle of Kyzikus, the testimony of
Diodorus outweighed, in my judgment, the silence of Xenophon; but
here Diodorus is silent also.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the exact sameness of the two alleged events
makes me think that the second is only a duplication of the first,
and that the Scholiast, in citing from Aristotle, mistook the battle
of Arginusæ for that of Kyzikus, which latter was by far the more
decisive of the two.</p>

<p>Diodorus (xiii, 105) and Cornelius Nepos (Alkib. c. 8) represent
Alkibiadês as wishing to be readmitted to a share in the command of
the fleet, and as promising, if that were granted, that he would
assemble a body of Thracians, attack Lysander by land, and compel him
to fight a battle or retire. Plutarch (Alkib. c. 37) alludes also to
promises of this sort held out by Alkibiadês.</p>

<p>Yet it is not likely that Alkibiadês should have talked of
anything so obviously impossible. How could he bring a Thracian
land-force to attack Lysander, who was on the opposite side of the
Hellespont? How could he carry a land-force across in the face of
Lysander’s fleet?</p>

<p>The representation of Xenophon (followed in my text) is clear and
intelligible.</p>

δὲ καὶ ἡ ἄλλη Ἑλλὰς ἀφειστήκει Ἀθηναίων, πλὴν Σαμίων· οὗτοι δὲ,
σφαγὰς τῶν γνωρίμων ποιήσαντες, κατεῖχον τὴν πόλιν.</p>

<p>I interpret the words σφαγὰς τῶν γνωρίμων ποιήσαντες to refer
to the violent revolution at Samos, described in Thucyd. viii, 21,
whereby the oligarchy were dispossessed and a democratical government
established. The word σφαγὰς is used by Xenophon (Hellen. v, 4, 14),
in a subsequent passage, to describe the conspiracy and revolution
effected by Pelopidas and his friends at Thebes. It is true that we
might rather have expected the preterite participle πεποιηκότες than
the aorist ποιήσαντες. But this employment of the aorist participle
in a preterite sense is not uncommon with Xenophon: see κατηγορήσας,
δόξας, i, 1, 31; γενομένους, i, 7, 11; ii, 2, 20.</p>

<p>It appears to me highly improbable that the Samians should have
chosen this occasion to make a fresh massacre of their oligarchical
citizens, as Mr. Mitford represents. The democratical Samians must
have been now humbled and intimidated, seeing their subjugation
approaching; and only determined to hold out by finding themselves
already so deeply compromised though the former revolution. Nor would
Lysander have spared them personally afterwards, as we shall find
that he did, when he had them substantially in his power (ii, 3, 6),
if they had now committed any fresh political massacre.</p>

<p>This seems the most probable story as to the death of Kleophon,
though the accounts are not all consistent, and the statement of
Xenophon, especially (Hellen. i, 7, 35), is not to be reconciled with
Lysias. Xenophon conceived Kleophon as having perished earlier than
this period, in a sedition (στάσεως τινος γενομένης ἐν ᾗ Κλεοφῶν
ἀπέθανε), before the flight of Kallixenus from his recognizances.
It is scarcely possible that Kallixenus could have been still under
recognizance, during this period of suffering between the battle of
Ægospotami and the capture of Athens. He must have escaped before
that battle. Neither long detention of an accused party in prison
before trial, nor long postponement of trial when he was under
recognizance were at all in Athenian habits.</p>

<p>The Thebans, a few years afterwards, when they were soliciting
aid from the Athenians against Sparta, disavowed this proposition
of their delegate Erianthus, who had been the leader of the Bœotian
contingent serving under Lysander at Ægospotami, honored in that
character by having his statue erected at Delphi, along with the
other allied leaders who took part in the battle, and along with
Lysander and Eteonikus (Pausan. x, 9, 4).</p>

<p>It is one of the exaggerations so habitual with Isokratês, to
serve a present purpose, when he says that the Thebans were the
<i>only</i> parties, among all the Peloponnesian confederates, who gave
this harsh anti-Athenian vote (Isokratês, Orat. Plataic. Or. xiv,
sect. 34).</p>

<p>Demosthenês says that the Phocians gave their vote, in the same
synod, against the Theban proposition (Demosth. de Fals. Legat. c.
22, p. 361).</p>

<p>It seems from Diodor. xv, 63, and Polyæn. i, 45, 5, as well as
from some passages in Xenophon himself, that the motives of the
Lacedæmonians, in thus resisting the proposition of the Thebans
against Athens, were founded in policy more than in generosity.</p>

<p>Lysias represents this accusation of the generals, and this
behavior of Agoratus, as having occurred <i>before</i> the surrender of
the city, but <i>after</i> the return of Theramenês, bringing back the
final terms imposed by the Lacedæmonians. He thus so colors it, that
Agoratus, by getting the generals out of the way, was the real cause
why the degrading peace brought by Theramenês was accepted. Had the
generals remained at large, he affirms, they would have prevented
the acceptance of this degrading peace, and would have been able to
obtain better terms from the Lacedæmonians (see Lysias cont. Agor.
sects. 16-20).</p>

<p>Without questioning generally the matters of fact set forth by
Lysias in this oration (delivered a long time afterwards, see s.
90), I believe that he <i>misdates</i> them, and represents them as
having occurred <i>before</i> the surrender, whereas they really occurred
<i>after</i> it. We know from Xenophon, that when Theramenês came back
the second time with the real peace, the people were in such a
state of famine, that farther waiting was impossible: the peace was
accepted immediately that it was proposed; cruel as it was, the
people were glad to get it (Xenoph. Hellen. ii, 2, 22). Besides,
how could Agoratus be conveyed with two vessels out of Munychia,
when the harbor was closely blocked up? and what is the meaning of
ἕως τὰ πράγματα κατασταίη, referred to a moment just <i>before</i> the
surrender?</p>

us that Sokratês and two of his friends were the only persons who
stood forward to protect Theramenês, when Satyrus was dragging him
from the altar. Plutarch (Vit. x, Orat. p. 836) ascribes the same act
of generous forwardness to <i>Isokratês</i>. There is no good ground for
believing it, either of one or of the other. None but senators were
present; and as this senate had been chosen by the Thirty, it is not
likely that either Sokratês or Isokratês were among its members. If
Sokratês had been a member of it, the fact would have been noticed
and brought out in connection with his subsequent trial.</p>

<p>The manner in which Plutarch (Consolat. ad Apollon. c. 6, p. 105)
states the death of Theramenês, that he was “tortured to death” by
the Thirty is an instance of his loose speaking.</p>

<p>Compare Cicero about the death of Theramenês (Tuscul. Disp. i, 40,
96). His admiration for the manner of death of Theramenês doubtless
contributed to make him rank that Athenian with Themistoklês and
Periklês (De Orat. iii. 16, 59).</p>

<p>Plutarch (Themistoklês, c. 19) affirms that the Thirty oligarchs,
during their rule, altered the position of the rostrum in the Pnyx,
the place where the democratical public assemblies were held: the
rostrum had before looked towards the sea, but they turned it so
as to make it look towards the land, because the maritime service
and the associations connected with it were the chief stimulants
of democratical sentiment. This story has been often copied and
reasserted, as if it were an undoubted fact; but M. Forchhammer
(Topographie von Athen, p. 289, in Kieler Philol. Studien. 1841) has
shown it to be untrue and even absurd.</p>

before occurred (Hellen. iii, 5, 5). He also specifies by name no one

contradiction to the spirit of our constitution did not instantly
produce, in fact, the grossest of the evils with which it was

at first very rarely exercised, that arbitrary power steals upon a
people. On the next unconstitutional act, all the fashionable world
will be ready to say: Your prophecies are ridiculous, your fears
are vain; you see how little of the misfortunes which you formerly
foreboded is come to pass. Thus, by degrees, that artful softening
of all arbitrary power, the alleged infrequency or narrow extent of
its operation, will be received as a sort of aphorism; and Mr. Hume
will not be singular in telling us that the felicity of mankind is no
more disturbed by it, than by earthquakes or thunder, or the other

various passages of the Orat. xii, of Lysias. Eratosthenês did not
stand alone on his trial, but in conjunction with other colleagues;
though of course, pursuant to the psephism of Kannônus, the vote
of the dikasts would be taken about each separately: ἀλλὰ παρὰ
Ἐρατοσθένους καὶ τῶν τουτουῒ συναρχόντων δίκην λαμβάνειν.... μηδ᾽
ἀποῦσι μὲν τοῖς τριάκοντα ἐπιβουλεύετε, παρόντας δ᾽ ἀφῆτε· μηδὲ τῆς
τύχης, ἣ τούτους παρέδωκε τῇ πόλει, κάκιον ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς βοηθήσητε
(sects. 80, 81): compare s. 36.</p>

<p>The number of friends prepared to back the defence of
Eratosthenês, and to obtain his acquittal, chiefly by representing
that he had done the least mischief of all the Thirty; that all that
he had done had been under fear of his own life; that he had been the
partisan and supporter of Theramenês, whose memory was at that time
popular, may be seen in sections 51, 56, 65, 87, 88, 91.</p>

<p>Putting together the two sentences in which the nomothetæ are
here mentioned, Reiske and F. A. Wolf (Prolegom. ad Demosthen. cont.
Leptin. p. cxxix), think that there were two classes of nomothetæ;
one class chosen by the senate, the other by the people. This appears
to me very improbable. The persons chosen by the senate were invested
with no final or decisive function whatever; they were simply chosen
to consider what new propositions were fit to be submitted for
discussion, and to provide that such propositions should be publicly
made known. Now any persons simply invested with this character
of a preliminary committee, would not, in my judgment, be called
nomothetæ. The reason why the persons here mentioned were so called,
was, that they were a portion of the five hundred nomothetæ, in whom
the power of peremptory decision ultimately rested. A small committee
would naturally be intrusted with this preliminary duty; and the
members of that small committee were to be chosen <i>by</i> one of the
bodies with whom ultimate decision rested, but chosen <i>out of</i> the
other.</p>

see (from Demosthen. cont. Timokrat. c. 15, p. 718) that Andokidês
has not cited the law fully. He has omitted the words, ὁπόσα δ᾽ ἐπὶ
τῶν τριάκοντα ἐπράχθη, ἢ ἰδίᾳ ἢ δημοσίᾳ, ἄκυρα εἶναι, these words not
having any material connection with the point at which he was aiming.
Compare Æschinês cont. Timarch. c. 9, p. 25, καὶ ἔστω ταῦτα ἄκυρα,
ὥσπερ τὰ ἐπὶ τῶν τριάκοντα, ἢ τὰ πρὸ Εὐκλείδου, ἢ εἴ τις ἄλλη πώποτε
τοιαύτη ἐγένετο προθεσμία....</p>

<p>Tisamenus is probably the same person of whom Lysias speaks
contemptuously, Or. xxx, cont. Nikomach. s. 36.</p>

<p>Meier (De Bonis Damnatorum, p. 71) thinks that there is a
contradiction between the decree proposed by Tisamenus (Andok. de
Myst. s. 83), and another decree proposed by Dioklês, cited in
the Oration of Demosth. cont. Timokr. c. 11, p. 713. But there is
no real contradiction between the two, and the only semblance of
contradiction that is to be found, arises from the fact that the law
of Dioklês is not correctly given as it now stands. It ought to be
read thus:—</p>

<p>Διοκλῆς εἶπε, Τοὺς νόμους τοὺς πρὸ Εὐκλείδου τεθέντας ἐν
δημοκρατίᾳ, καὶ ὅσοι <em class="gesperrt">ἐπ᾽</em> Εὐκλείδου
ἐτέθησαν, καὶ εἰσὶν ἀναγεγραμμένοι, [<em class="gesperrt">ἀπ᾽
Εὐκλείδου</em>] κυρίους εἶναι· τοὺς δὲ μετ᾽ Εὐκλείδην τεθέντας καὶ
τολοιπὸν τιθεμένους κυρίους εἶναι ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἕκαστος ἐτέθη,
πλὴν εἴ τῳ προσγέγραπται χρόνος ὅντινα δεῖ ἄρχειν. Ἐπιγράψαι δὲ, τοῖς
μὲν νῦν κειμένοις, τὸν γραμματέα τῆς βουλῆς, τριάκοντα ἡμερῶν· τὸ δὲ
λοιπὸν, ὃς ἂν τυγχάνῃ γραμματεύων, προσγραφέτω παραχρῆμα τὸν νόμον
κύριον εἶναι ἀπὸ τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς ἐτέθη.</p>

<p>The words ἀπ᾽ <em class="gesperrt">Εὐκλείδου</em>, which stand
between brackets in the second line, are inserted on my own
conjecture; and I venture to think that any one who will read the
whole law through, and the comments of the orator upon it, will see
that they are imperatively required to make the sense complete. The
entire scope and purpose of the law is, to regulate clearly the time
<i>from which</i> each law shall begin to be valid.</p>

<p>As the first part of the law reads now, without these words, it
has no pertinence, no bearing on the main purpose contemplated by
Dioklês in the second part, nor on the reasonings of Demosthenês
afterwards. It is easy to understand how the words ἀπ᾽ Εὐκλείδου
should have dropped out, seeing that ἐπ᾽ Εὐκλείδου immediately
precedes: another error has been in fact introduced, by putting <em
class="gesperrt">ἀπ᾽</em> Εὐκλείδου in the former case instead of <em
class="gesperrt">ἐπ᾽</em> Εὐκλείδου, which error has been corrected
by various recent editors, on the authority of some MSS.</p>

<p>The law of Dioklês, when properly read, fully harmonizes with that
of Tisamenus. Meier wonders that there is no mention made of the
δοκιμασία νόμων by the nomothetæ, which is prescribed in the decree
of Tisamenus. But it was not necessary to mention this expressly,
since the words ὅσοι εἰσὶν ἀναγεγραμμένοι presuppose the foregone
δοκιμασία.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_475"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_475">[475]</a></span> The Orat. xviii, of Isokratês,
Paragraphê cont. Kallimachum, informs us on these points, especially
sections 1-4.</p>

<p>Kallimachus had entered an action against the client of
Isokratês for ten thousand drachmæ (sects. 15-17), charging him
as an accomplice of Patroklês,—the king-archon under the Ten,
who immediately succeeded the Thirty, prior to the return of the
exiles,—in seizing and confiscating a sum of money belonging to
Kallimachus. The latter, in commencing this action, was under the
necessity of paying the fees called <i>prytaneia</i>; a sum proportional
to what was claimed, and amounting to thirty drachmæ, when the
sum claimed was between one thousand and ten thousand drachmæ.
Suppose that action had gone to trial directly, Kallimachus, if he
lost his cause, would have to forfeit his prytaneia, but he would
forfeit no more. Now according to the paragraphê permitted by the
law of Archinus, the defendant is allowed to make oath that the
action against him is founded upon a fact prior to the archonship
of Eukleidês; and a cause is then tried first, upon that special
issue, upon which the defendant is allowed to speak first, before the
plaintiff. If the verdict, on this special issue, is given in favor
of the defendant, the plaintiff is not only disabled from proceeding
further with his action, but is condemned besides to pay to the
defendant the forfeit called epobely: that is, one-sixth part of the
sum claimed. But if, on the contrary, the verdict on the special
issue be in favor of the plaintiff, he is held entitled to proceed
farther with his original action, and to receive besides at once,

<p id="Footnote_476"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_476">[476]</a></span> Wachsmuth—who admits into his
work, with little or no criticism, everything which has ever been
said against the Athenian people, and indeed against the Greeks
generally—affirms, contrary to all evidence and probability, that the
amnesty was not really observed at Athens. (Wachsm. Hellen. Alterth.
ch. ix. sect. 71, vol. ii, p. 267.)</p>

<p>The simple and distinct words of Xenophon, coming as they do from
the mouth of so very hostile a witness, are sufficient to refute
him: καὶ ὀμόσαντες ὅρκους ἦ μὴν μὴ μνησικακήσειν, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ὁμοῦ
γε πολιτεύονται, καὶ <em class="gesperrt">τοῖς ὅρκοις ἐμμένει ὁ
δῆμος</em>, (Hellen. ii, 4, 43).</p>

<p>The passages to which Wachsmuth makes reference, do not in the
least establish his point. Even if actions at law or accusations
had been brought, in violation of the amnesty, this would not prove
that the people violated it; unless we also knew that the dikastery
had affirmed those actions. But he does not refer to any actions
or accusations preferred on any such ground. He only notices some
cases in which, accusation being preferred on grounds subsequent
to Eukleidês, the accuser makes allusion in his speech to other
matters anterior to Eukleidês. Now every speaker before the Athenian
dikastery thinks himself entitled to call up before the dikasts the
whole past life of his opponent, in the way of analogous evidence
going to attest the general character of the latter, good or bad.
For example, the accuser of Sokratês mentions, as a point going to
impeach the general character of Sokratês, that he had been the
teacher of Kritias; while the philosopher, in his defence, alludes to
his own resolution and virtue as prytanis in the assembly by which
the generals were condemned after the battle of Arginusæ. Both these
allusions come out as evidences to general character.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the young Alkibiadês (in the Orat. xvi,
of Isokratês, De Bigis, sect. 56) is made to talk about others
recovering their property: τῶν ἄλλων κομιζομένων τὰς οὐσίας. My
statement in the text reconciles these two. The young Alkibiadês goes
on to state that the people had passed a vote to grant compensation
to him for the confiscation of his father’s property, but that the
power of his enemies had disappointed him of it. We may well doubt
whether such vote ever really passed.</p>

<p>It appears, however, that Batrachus, one of the chief informers
who brought in victims for the Thirty, thought it prudent to live
afterwards out of Attica (Lysias cont. Andokid. Or. vi, sect. 46),

correctly explained by M. Boeckh as having a very restricted meaning,

doubt whether, in practice, it was rigidly adhered to; though it
is possible to suppose that these secretaries alternated, among
themselves, from one board or office to another. Their great

<p id="Footnote_506"><span class="label"><a

the most probable account of the death of Alkibiadês from Plutarch,
Alkib. c. 38, 39; Diodorus, xiv, 11 (who cites Ephorus, compare
Ephor. Fragm. 126, ed. Didot); Cornelius Nepos, Alkibiad. c. 10;
Justin, v, 8; Isokratês, Or. xvi, De Bigis, s. 50.</p>

<p>There were evidently different stories, about the antecedent
causes and circumstances, among which a selection must be made. The
extreme perfidy ascribed by Ephorus to Pharnabazus appears to me not
at all in the character of that satrap.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_507"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_507">[507]</a></span> Cornelius Nepos says (Alcib.
c. 11) of Alkibiadês: “Hunc infamatum a plerisque tres gravissimi
historici summis laudibus extulerunt: Thucydides, qui ejusdem ætatis
fuit; Theopompus, qui fuit post aliquando natus, et Timæus: qui
quidem duo maledicentissimi, nescio quo modo, in illo uno laudando
conscierunt.”</p>

<p>We have no means of appreciating what was said by Theopompus and
Timæus. But as to Thucydidês, it is to be recollected that he extols
only the capacity and warlike enterprise of Alkibiadês, nothing
beyond; and he had good reason for doing so. His picture of the
dispositions and conduct of Alkibiadês is the reverse of eulogy.</p>

<p>The Oration xvi, of Isokratês, De Bigis, spoken by the son of
Alkibiadês, goes into a labored panegyric of his father’s character,
but is prodigiously inaccurate, if we compare it with the facts
stated in Thucydidês and Xenophon. But he is justified in saying:
οὐδέποτε τοῦ πατρὸς ἡγουμένου τρόπαιον ὑμῶν ἔστησαν οἱ πολέμιοι (s.
23).</p>

<p id="Footnote_508"><span class="label"><a

Sophoklês was surpassed by the rival composition of Philoklês. The
Medea of Euripidês stood only third for the prize; Euphorion, son of
Æschylus, being first, Sophoklês second. Yet these two tragedies are
the masterpieces now remaining of Sophoklês and Euripidês.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_509"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_509">[509]</a></span> The careful examination of
Welcker (Griech. Tragödie. vol. i, p. 76) makes out the titles
of eighty tragedies unquestionably belonging to Sophoklês, over
and above the satyrical dramas in his tetralogies. Welcker has
considerably cut down the number admitted by previous authors,
carried by Fabricius as high as one hundred and seventy-eight, and
even, by Boeckh, as high as one hundred and nine (Welcker, <i>ut sup.</i>
p. 62).</p>

<p>The number of dramas ascribed to Euripidês is sometimes
ninety-two, sometimes seventy-five. Elmsley, in his remarks on
the Argument to the Medea, p. 72, thinks that even the larger of
these numbers is smaller than what Euripidês probably composed;
since the poet continued composing for fifty years, from 455 to 405
<small>B.C.</small>, and was likely during each year
to have composed one, if not two, tetralogies; if he could prevail
upon the archon to grant him a chorus, that is, the opportunity of
representing. The didaskalies took no account of any except such as
gained the first, second, or third prize. Welcker gives the titles,
and an approximative guess at the contents, of fifty-one lost
tragedies of the poet, besides the seventeen remaining (p. 443).</p>

<p>Aristarchus the tragedian is affirmed by Suidas to have composed
seventy tragedies, of which only two gained the prize. As many as a
hundred and twenty compositions are ascribed to Neophron, forty-four
to Achæus, forty to Ion (Welcker, ib. p. 889).</p>

<p>Aristotle (Poetic, c. 4) tells us that these phallic processions,
with liberty to the leaders (οἱ ἐξάρχοντες) of scoffing at every one,
still continued in many cities of Greece in his time: see Herod.
v, 83, and Sêmus apud Athenæum, xiv, p. 622; also the striking
description of the rural Dionysia in the Acharneis of Aristophanês,
235, 255, 1115. The scoffing was a part of the festival, and supposed
to be agreeable to Dionysus: ἐν τοῖς Διονυσίοις ἐφειμένον αὐτὸ δρᾷν·
καὶ τὸ σκῶμμα μέρος τι ἐδόκει τῆς ἑορτῆς· καὶ ὁ θεὸς ἴσως χαίρει,
φιλογέλως τις ὤν (Lucian, Piscator. c. 25). Compare Aristophanês,
Ranæ, 367, where the poet seems to imply that no one has a right to
complain of being ridiculed in the πατρίοις τελεταῖς Διονύσου.</p>

<p>The Greek word for comedy—κωμῳδία, τὸ κωμῳδεῖν—at least in its
early sense, had reference to a bitter, insulting, criminative
ridicule: κωμῳδεῖν καὶ κακῶς λέγειν (Xenophon, Repub. Ath. ii,
23)—κακηγοροῦντάς τε καὶ κωμῳδοῦντας ἀλλήλους καὶ αἰσχρολογοῦντας

appears in Bekker’s Anecdota Græca, ii, 747, 10: Κωμῳδία ἐστιν ἡ
ἐν μέσῳ λάου κατηγορία, ἤγουν δημοσίευσις; “public exposure to
scorn before the assembled people:” and this idea of it as a penal
visitation of evil-doers is preserved in Platonius and the anonymous
writers on comedy, prefixed to Aristophanês. The definition which
Aristotle (Poetic. c. 11) gives of it, is too mild for the primitive
comedy: for he tells us himself that Kratês, immediately preceding
Aristophanês, was the first author who departed from the ἰαμβικὴ
ἰδέα: this “iambic vein” was originally the common character. It
doubtless included every variety of ridicule, from innocent mirth to
scornful contempt and odium; but the predominant character tended
decidedly to the latter.</p>

attacked the powerful men, he did not leave the smaller persons

reputation of another citizen.</p>

<p>Among the constant butts of Aristophanês and the other comic
composers, was the dithyrambic poet Kinesias, upon whom they
discharged their wit and bitterness, not simply as an indifferent
poet, but also on the ground of his alleged impiety, his thin and
feeble bodily frame, and his wretched health. We see the effect of
such denunciations in a speech of the orator Lysias; composed on
behalf of Phanias, against whom Kinesias had brought an indictment,
or graphê paranomôn. Phanias treats these abundant lampoons as if
they were good evidence against the character of Kinesias: Θαυμάζω δ᾽
εἰ μὴ βαρέως φέρετε ὅτι Κινησίας ἐστὶν ὁ τοῖς νόμοις βοηθὸς, ὃν ὑμεῖς

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_528"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_528">[528]</a></span> The view which I am here
combating, is very general among the German writers; in proof of
which, I may point to three of the ablest recent critics on the old
comedy, Bergk, Meineke, and Ranke; all most useful writers for the
understanding of Aristophanês.</p>

<p>Respecting Kratinus, Bergk observes: “Erat enim Cratinus, <i>pariter
atque ceteri principes antiquæ comœdiæ, vir egregie moratus</i>, idemque
antiqui moris tenax.... Cum Cratinus <i>quasi divinitus videret</i> ex hac
libertate mox tanquam ex stirpe aliquâ nimiam licentiam existere et
nasci, statim his initiis graviter adversatus est, videturque Cimonem
tanquam exemplum boni et honesti civis proposuisse,” etc.</p>

<p>“Nam Cratinus cum esset magno ingenio et <i>eximiâ morum gravitate</i>,
ægerrime tulit rem publicam præceps in perniciem ruere: omnem igitur
operam atque omne studium eo contulit, ut <i>imagine ipsius vitæ ante
oculos positâ omnes et res divinæ et humanæ emendarentur, hominumque
animi ad honestatem colendam incenderentur</i>. Hoc sibi primus et
proposuit Cratinus, et propositum strenue persecutus est. <i>Sed si
ipsam Veritatem, cujus imago oculis obversabatur, oculis subjecisset,
verendum erat ne tædio obrueret eos qui spectarent</i>, nihilque prorsus
eorum, quæ summo studio persequebatur, obtineret. Quare eximiâ quâdam
arte pulchram effigiem hilaremque formam finxit, ita tamen ut ad
veritatem sublimemque ejus speciem referret omnia: sic cum ludicris
miscet seria, ut et vulgus haberet quî delectaretur; et qui plus
ingenio valerent, ipsam veritatem, quæ ex omnibus fabularum partibus
perluceret, mente et cogitatione comprehenderent.” ... “Jam vero
Cratinum in fabulis componendis id <i>unice spectavisse quod esset
verum</i>, ne veteres quidem latuit.... Aristophanes autem <i>idem et
secutus semper est</i> et sæpe professus.” (Bergk, De Reliquiis Comœd.
Antiq. pp. 1, 10, 20, 233, etc.)</p>

<p>The criticism of Ranke (Commentatio de Vitâ Aristophanis, pp.
ccxli, cccxiv, cccxlii, ccclxix, ccclxxiii, cdxxxiv, etc.) adopts
the same strain of eulogy as to the lofty and virtuous purposes of
Aristophanês. Compare also the eulogy bestowed by Meineke on the
monitorial value of the old comedy (Historia Comic. Græc. pp. 39,
50, 165, etc.), and similar praises by Westermann; Geschichte der
Beredsamkeit in Griechenland und Rom. sect. 36.</p>

<p>In one of the arguments prefixed to the “Pax” of Aristophanês,
the author is so full of the conception of these poets as public
instructors or advisers, that he tells us, absurdly enough, they
were for that reason called <em class="gesperrt">διδάσκαλοι</em>:
οὐδὲν γὰρ συμβούλων διέφερον· ὅθεν αὐτοὺς καὶ <em
class="gesperrt">διδασκάλους</em> ὠνόμαζον· ὅτι πάντα τὰ <em
class="gesperrt">πρόσφορα διὰ δραμάτων αὐτοὺς ἐδίδασκον</em> (p. 244,
ed. Bekk.).</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="i0">“Eupolis, atque Cratinus, Aristophanesque poetæ,</p>
<p class="i0">Atque alii, quorum Comœdia prisca virorum est,</p>
<p class="i0">Si quis erat dignus describi, quod malus, aut fur,</p>
<p class="i0">Aut mœchus foret, aut sicarius, aut alioqui</p>
<p class="i0">Famosus, multâ cum libertate notabant.”</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1 ti0">This is the early judgment of Horace (Serm. i, 4,
1): his later opinion on the <i>Fescennina licentia</i>, which was the
same in spirit as the old Grecian comedy, is much more judicious
(Epistol. ii, 1, 145): compare Art. Poetic. 224. To assume that
the persons derided or vilified by these comic authors must always
have deserved what was said of them, is indeed a striking evidence
of the value of the maxim: “Fortiter calumniare; semper aliquid
restat.” Without doubt, their indiscriminate libel sometimes wounded
a suitable subject; in what proportion of cases, we have no means of
determining: but the perusal of Aristophanês tends to justify the
epithets which Lucian puts into the mouth of <i>Dialogus</i> respecting
Aristophanês and Eupolis—not to favor the opinions of the authors
whom I have cited above (Lucian, Jov. Accus. vol. ii, p. 832). He
calls Eupolis and Aristophanês δεινοὺς ἄνδρας ἐπικερτομῆσαι τὰ σεμνὰ
καὶ χλευάσαι τὰ καλῶς ἔχοντα.</p>

<p>When we notice what Aristophanês himself says respecting the other
comic poets, his predecessors and contemporaries, we shall find it
far from countenancing the exalted censorial function which Bergk
and others ascribe to them (see the Parabasis in the Nubes, 530,
<i>seq.</i>, and in the Pax, 723). It seems especially preposterous to
conceive Kratinus in that character; of whom what we chiefly know, is
his habit of drunkenness, and the downright, unadorned vituperation
in which he indulged: see the Fragments and story of his last play,
Πυτίνη (in Meineke, vol. ii, p. 116; also Meineke, vol. i, p. 48,
<i>seq.</i>).</p>

<p>Meineke copies (p. 46) from Suidas a statement (v.
Ἐπείου δειλότερος) to the effect that Kratinus was <em
class="gesperrt">ταξίαρχος τῆς Οἰνηΐδος φυλῆς</em>. He construes
this as a real fact: but there can hardly be a doubt that it is
only a joke made by his contemporary comedians upon his fondness
for wine; and not one of the worst among the many such jests which
seem to have been then current. Runkel also, another editor of the
Fragments of Kratinus (Cratini Fragment., Leips. 1827, p. 2, M. M.
Runkel), construes this ταξίαρχος τῆς Οἰνηΐδος φυλῆς, as if it were
a serious function; though he tells us about the general character
of Kratinus: “De vitâ ipsâ et moribus pæne nihil dicere possumus:
<i>hoc solum constat, Cratinum poculis et puerorum amori valde deditum
fuisse</i>.”</p>

<p>Great numbers of Aristophanic jests have been transcribed as
serious matter-of-fact, and have found their way into Grecian
history. Whoever follows chapter vii of K. F. Hermann’s Griechische
Staats-Alterthümer, containing the <i>Innere Geschichte</i> of the
Athenian democracy, will see the most sweeping assertions made
against the democratical institutions, on the authority of passages
of Aristophanês: the same is the case with several of the other most
learned German manuals of Grecian affairs.</p>

the Symposion of Plato; though the scheme and purpose of this latter

Mr. Fynes Clinton, Brandis, and Karsten, in thinking that this is
better evidence, about the date of Parmenidês than any of the vague
indications which appear to contradict it, in Diogenes Laërtius and
elsewhere. But it will be hardly proper to place the conversation
between Parmenidês and Sokratês—as Mr. Clinton places it, Fast.
H. vol. ii, App. c. 21, p. 364—at a time when Sokratês was only
fifteen years of age. The ideas which the ancients had about youthful
propriety, would not permit him to take part in conversation with
an eminent philosopher at so early an age as fifteen, when he would
not yet be entered on the roll of citizens, or be qualified for
the smallest function, military or civil. I cannot but think that
Sokratês must have been more than twenty years of age when he thus
conversed with Parmenidês.</p>

<p>Sokratês was born in 469 <small>B.C.</small> (perhaps
468 <small>B.C.</small>); he would therefore be twenty
years of age in 449: assuming the visit of Parmenidês to Athens
to have been in 448 <small>B.C.</small>, since he
was then sixty-five years of age, he would be born in 513 <small>B.C.</small> It is objected that, if this date be
admitted, Parmenidês could not have been a pupil of Xenophanês: we
should thus he compelled to admit, which perhaps is the truth, that
he learned the doctrine of Xenophanês at second-hand.</p>

<p id="Footnote_553"><span class="label"><a

of the abundance of such jealousies and antipathies during the times
of Plato, Aristotle, and Isokratês; see Stahr’s Aristotelia, ch. iii,
vol. i, pp. 37, 68.</p>

<p>Aristotle was extremely jealous of the success of Isokratês, and
was himself much assailed by pupils of the latter, Kephisodôrus and
others, as well as by Dikæarchus, Eubulidês, and a numerous host of
writers in the same tone: στρατὸν ὅλον τῶν ἐπιθεμένων Ἀριστοτέλει;
see the Fragments of Dikæarchus, vol. ii, p. 225, ed. Didot. “De
ingenio ejus (observes Cicero, in reference to Epicurus, de Finibus,
ii, 25, 80) in his disputationibus, non de moribus, quæritur. Sit
ista in Græcorum levitate perversitas, qui maledictis insectantur
eos, a quibus de veritate dissentiunt.” This is a taint no way
peculiar to <i>Grecian</i> philosophical controversy; but it has nowhere
been more infectious than among the Greeks, and modern historians
cannot be too much on their guard against it.</p>

Periklês, c. 4. Ὁ δὲ Δάμων ἐοικεν, ἄκρος ὢν σοφιστὴς, καταδύεσθαι

<p>So Protagoras too (in the speech put into his mouth by Plato,
Protag. c. 8, p. 316) says, very truly, that there had been sophists
from the earliest times of Greece. But he says also, what Plutarch
says in the citation just above, that these earlier men refused,
intentionally and deliberately, to call themselves sophists, for fear
of the odium attached to the name; and that he, Protagoras, was the
first person to call himself openly a sophist.</p>

<p>The denomination by which a man is known, however, seldom depends
upon himself, but upon the general public, and upon his critics,
friendly or hostile. The unfriendly spirit of Plato did much more to
attach the title of sophists specially to these teachers, than any
assumption of their own.</p>

Sophist.), sect. 9 (compare Heindorf’s note ad Platon. Euthydem.
sect. 79); Orat. xii (Panath.), sect. 126; Orat. xv (Perm.), sect.
90.</p>

<p>Isokratês, in the beginning of his Orat. x, Encom. Helenæ,
censures all the speculative teachers; first, Antisthenês and Plato
(without naming them, but identifying them sufficiently by their
doctrines); next, Protagoras, Gorgias, Melissus, Zeno, etc., by name,
as having wasted their time and teaching on fruitless paradox and
controversy. He insists upon the necessity of teaching with a view to
political life and to the course of actual public events, abandoning
these useless studies (sect. 6).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that what Isokratês recommends is just what
Protagoras and Gorgias are represented as actually doing—each
doubtless in his own way—in the dialogues of Plato, who censures them
for being too practical, while Isokratês, commenting on them from
various publications which they left, treats them only as teachers of
useless speculations.</p>

<p>In the Oration De Permutatione, composed when he was eighty-two
years of age (sect. 10, the orations above cited are earlier
compositions, especially Orat. xiii, against the sophists, see
sect. 206), Isokratês stands upon the defensive, and vindicates his
profession against manifold aspersions. It is a most interesting
oration, as a defence of the educators of Athens generally, and would
serve perfectly well as a vindication of the teaching of Protagoras,
Gorgias, Hippias, etc., against the reproaches of Plato.</p>

<p>This oration should be read, if only to get at the genuine
Athenian sense of the word sophists, as distinguished from the
technical sense which Plato and Aristotle fasten upon it. The word
is here used in its largest sense, as distinguished from ἰδιώταις
(sect. 159): it meant, literary men or philosophers generally,
but especially the professional teachers: it carried, however, an
obnoxious sense, and was therefore used as little as possible by
themselves; as much as possible by those who disliked them.</p>

<p>Isokratês, though he does not willingly call himself by this
unpleasant name, yet is obliged to acknowledge himself unreservedly
as one of the profession, in the same category as Gorgias (sects.
165, 179, 211, 213, 231, 256), and defends the general body as well
as himself; distinguishing himself of course from the bad members
of the profession, those who pretended to be sophists, but devoted
themselves to something different in reality (sect. 230).</p>

<p>This professional teaching, and the teachers, are signified
indiscriminately by these words: οἱ σοφισταί—οἱ περὶ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν
διατρίβοντες—τὴν φιλοσοφίαν ἀδίκως διαβεβλημένην (sects. 44, 157,
159, 179, 211, 217, 219)—ἡ τῶν λόγων παιδεία—ἡ τῶν λόγων μελέτη—ἡ
φιλοσοφία—ἡ τῆς φρονήσεως ἄσκησις—τῆς ἐμῆς, εἴτε βούλεσθε καλεῖν
δυνάμεως, εἴτε φιλοσοφίας, εἴτε διατρίβης (sects. 53, 187, 189, 193,
196). All these expressions mean the same process of training; that
is, general mental training as opposed to bodily (sects. 194, 199),
and intended to cultivate the powers of thought, speech, and action:
πρὸς τὸ λέγειν καὶ φρονεῖν—τοῦ φρονεῖν εὖ καὶ λέγειν—τὸ λέγειν καὶ
πράττειν (sects. 221, 261, 285, 296, 330).</p>

<p>Isokratês does not admit any such distinction between the
philosopher and dialectician on the one side, and the sophist on
the other, as Plato and Aristotle contend for. He does not like
dialectical exercises: yet he admits them to be useful for youth,
as a part of intellectual training, on condition that all such
speculations shall be dropped, when the youth come into active life
(sects. 280, 287).</p>

<p>This is the same language as that of Kalliklês in the Gorgias of
Plato, c. 40, p. 484.</p>

Xenophon, at the close of his treatise De Venatione (c. 13),
introduces a sharp censure upon the sophists, with very little
that is specific or distinct. He accuses them of teaching command
and artifice of words, instead of communicating useful maxims;
of speaking for purposes of deceit, or for their own profit, and
addressing themselves to rich pupils for pay; while the <i>philosopher</i>
gives his lessons to every one gratuitously, without distinction of
persons. This is the same distinction as that taken by Sokratês and
Plato, between the sophist and the philosopher: compare Xenoph. De
Vectigal. v, 4.</p>

328, B. Diogenes Laërtius (ix, 58) says that Protagoras demanded
one hundred minæ as pay: little stress is to be laid upon such a
statement, nor is it possible that he could have had one fixed rate
of pay. The story told by Aulus Gellius (v, 10) about the suit at law
between Protagoras and his disciple Euathlus, is at least amusing
and ingenious. Compare the story of the rhetor Skopelianus, in
Philostratus, Vit. Sophist. i, 21, 4.</p>

<p>Isokratês (Or. xv, de Perm. sect. 166) affirms that the gains made
by Gorgias, or by any of the eminent sophists, had never been very
high; that they had been greatly and maliciously exaggerated; that
they were very inferior to those of the great dramatic actors (sect.
168).</p>

Ritter (p. 582) and Brandis (p. 521) quote very unfairly the evidence

If Aristophanês is a witness against any one, he is a witness against
Sokratês, who is the person singled out for attack in the “Clouds.”
But these authors, not admitting Aristophanês as an evidence against
Sokratês, whom he <i>does</i> attack, nevertheless quote him as an

<p>This theory of Protagoras is discussed in the dialogue called
Theætetus, p. 152, <i>seq.</i>, in a long but desultory way.</p>

<p>See Sextus Empiric. Pyrrhonic. Hypol. i. 216-219, et contra
Mathematicos, vii, 60-64. The explanation which Sextus gives of the
Protagorean doctrine, in the former passage, cannot be derived from
the treatise of Protagoras himself; since he makes use of the word
ὕλη in the philosophical sense, which was not adopted until the days
of Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p>It is difficult to make out what Diogenes Laërtius states about
other tenets of Protagoras, and to reconcile them with the doctrine
of “man being the measure of all things,” as explained by Plato
(Diog. Laërt. ix, 51, 57).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_586"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_586">[586]</a></span> Aristotle (in one of the
passages of his Metaphysica, wherein he discusses the Protagorean
doctrine, x, i, p. 1053, B.) says that this doctrine comes to
nothing more than saying, that man, so far as cognizant, or so
far as percipient, is the measure of all things; in other words,
that knowledge, or perception, is the measure of all things. This,
Aristotle says, is trivial, and of no value, though it sounds like
something of importance: Πρωταγόρας δ᾽ ἄνθρωπόν φησι πάντων εἶναι
μέτρον, ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ τὸν ἐπιστήμονα εἰπὼν ἢ τὸν αἰσθανόμενον· τούτους
δ᾽ ὅτι ἔχουσιν ὁ μὲν αἴσθησιν ὁ δὲ ἐπιστήμην· ἅ φαμεν εἶναι μέτρα τῶν
ὑποκειμένων. Οὐθὲν δὴ λέγων περιττὸν φαίνεταί τι λέγειν.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that to insist upon the essentially relative
nature of cognizable truth, was by no means a trivial or unimportant
doctrine, as Aristotle pronounces it to be; especially when we
compare it with the unmeasured conceptions of the objects and
methods of scientific research which were so common in the days of
Protagoras.</p>

<p>Compare Metaphysic. iii, 5, pp. 1008, 1009, where it will be
seen how many other thinkers of that day carried the same doctrine,
seemingly, further than Protagoras.</p>

<p>Protagoras remarked that the observed movements of the heavenly
bodies did not coincide with that which the astronomers represented
them to be, and to which they applied their mathematical reasonings.
This remark was a criticism on the mathematical astronomers of his
day—ἐλέγχων τοὺς γεωμέτρας (Aristot. Metaph. iii, 2, p. 998, A). We
know too little how far his criticism may have been deserved, to
assent to the general strictures of Ritter, Gesch. der Phil. vol. i,
p. 633.</p>

διοικοῖ, καὶ περὶ τῶν τῆς πόλεως, ὅπως τὰ τῆς πόλεως δυνατώτατος εἴη
καὶ πράττειν καὶ λέγειν. (Plato, Protagoras, c. 9, p. 318, E.)</p>

<p>A similar description of the moral teaching of Protagoras and
the other sophists, yet comprising a still larger range of duties,
towards parents, friends, and fellow-citizens in their private
capacities, is given in Plato, Meno. p. 91, B, E.</p>

<p>Isokratês describes the education which he wished to convey,
almost in the same words: Τοὺς τὰ τοιαῦτα μανθάνοντας καὶ μελετῶντας
ἐξ ὧν καὶ τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον καὶ τὰ κοινὰ τὰ τῆς πόλεως καλῶς
διοικήσουσιν, ὧνπερ ἕνεκα καὶ πονητέον καὶ φιλοσοφητέον καὶ πάντα
πρακτέον ἐστί (Or. xv, De Permutat. s. 304; compare 289).</p>

<p>Xenophon also describes, almost in the same words, the teaching
of Sokratês. Kriton and others sought the society of Sokratês: οὐκ
ἵνα δημηγορικοὶ ἢ δικανικοὶ γένοιντο, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα καλοί τε κἀγαθοὶ
γενόμενοι, καὶ οἴκῳ καὶ οἰκέταις καὶ οἰκείοις καὶ φίλοις καὶ πόλει
καὶ πολίταις δύναιντο καλῶς χρῆσθαι (Memor. i, 2, 48). Again, i,
2, 64: Φανερὸς ἦν Σωκράτης τῶν συνόντων τοὺς πονηρὰς ἐπιθυμίας
ἔχοντας, τούτων μὲν παύων, <em class="gesperrt">τῆς δὲ καλλίστης καὶ
μεγαλοπρεπεστάτης ἀρετῆς, ᾗ πόλεις τε καὶ οἴκοι εὖ οἰκοῦσι</em>,
προτρέπων ἐπιθυμεῖν. Compare also i, 6, 15; ii, 1, 19; iv, 1, 2; iv,
5, 10.</p>

<p>When we perceive how much analogy Xenophon establishes—so far
as regards practical precept, apart from theory or method—between
Sokratês, Protagoras, Prodikus, etc., it is difficult to justify
the representations of the commentators respecting the sophists;
see Stallbaum, Proleg. ad Platon Menon. p. 8. “Etenim virtutis
nomen, cum propter ambitûs magnitudinem valde esset ambiguum et
obscurum, sophistæ interpretabantur sic, ut, missâ veræ honestatis
et probitatis vi, unice de prudentiâ civili ac domesticâ cogitari
vellent, eoque modo totam virtutem <i>ad callidum quoddam utilitatis
vel privatim vel publice consequendæ artificium</i> revocarent.” ...
“Pervidit hanc <i>opinionis istius perversitatem, ejusque turpitudinem</i>
intimo sensit pectore, vir sanctissimi animi, Socratês, etc.”
Stallbaum speaks to the same purpose in his Prolegomena to the
Protagoras, pp. 10, 11; and to the Euthydemus, pp. 21, 22.</p>

<p>Those who, like these censors on the sophists, think it <i>base</i> to
recommend virtuous conduct by the mutual security and comfort which
it procures to all parties, must be prepared to condemn on the same
ground a large portion of what is said by Sokratês throughout the
Memorabilia of Xenophon, Μὴ καταφρόνει τῶν οἰκονομικῶν ἀνδρῶν, etc.
(ii, 4, 12); see also his Œconomic. xi, 10.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_600"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_600">[600]</a></span> Stallbaum, Prolegomena
ad Platonis Menonem, p. 9: “Etenim sophistæ, quum virtutis
exercitationem et ad utilitates externas referent, et facultate
quâdam atque consuetudine ejus, quod utile videretur, reperiendi,
absolvi statuerent,—Socrates ipse, rejectâ <i>utilitatis turpitudine</i>,
vim naturamque virtutis unice ad id quod bonum honestumque est,
revocavit; voluitque esse in eo, ut quis recti bonique sensu ac
scientâ polleret, ad quam tanquam ad certissimam normam atque regulam
actiones suas omnes dirigeret atque poneret.”</p>

<p>Whoever will compare this criticism with the Protagoras of Plato,
c. 36, 37, especially p. 357, B, wherein Sokratês identifies good
with pleasure and evil with pain, and wherein he considers right
conduct to consist in justly calculating the items of pleasure and
pain one against the other, ἡ μετρητικὴ τέχνη, will be astonished how
a critic on Plato could write what is above cited. I am aware that
there are other parts of Plato’s dialogues in which he maintains a
doctrine different from that just alluded to. Accordingly, Stallbaum
(in his Prolegomena to the Protagoras, p. 30) contends that Plato
is here setting forth a doctrine not his own, but is reasoning
on the principles of Protagoras, for the purpose of entrapping
and confounding him: “Quæ hic de fortitudine disseruntur, ea item
cavendum est ne protenus pro decretis mere Platonicis habeantur.
Disputat enim Socrates pleraque omnia ad mentem ipsius Protagoræ,
ita quidem ut eum per suam ipsius rationem in fraudem et errorem
inducat.”</p>

<p>I am happy to be able to vindicate Plato against the disgrace
of so dishonest a spirit of argumentation as that which Stallbaum
ascribes to him. Plato most certainly does not reason here upon
the doctrines or principles of Protagoras; for the latter begins
by positively denying the doctrine, and is only brought to admit
it in a very qualified manner, c. 35, p. 351, D. He says, in reply
to the question of Sokratês: Οὐκ οἶδα ἁπλῶς οὕτως, ὡς σὺ ἐρωτᾷς,
εἰ ἐμοὶ ἀποκριτέον ἐστὶν, ὡς τὰ ἡδέα τε ἀγαθά ἐστιν ἅπαντα καὶ τὰ
ἀνιαρὰ κακά· ἀλλὰ μοι δοκεῖ οὐ μόνον πρὸς τὴν νῦν ἀπόκρισιν ἐμοὶ
ἀσφαλέστερον εἶναι ἀποκρίνασθαι, <em class="gesperrt">ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς
πάντα τὸν ἄλλον βίον τὸν ἐμὸν</em>, ὅτι ἐστὶ μὲν ἃ τῶν ἡδέων οὔκ
ἐστιν ἀγαθὰ, ἐστὶ δὲ αὖ καὶ ἃ τῶν ἀνιαρῶν οὐκ ἐστι κακὰ, ἐστὶ δὲ ἃ
ἐστι, καὶ τρίτον ἃ οὐδέτερα, οὔτε κακὰ οὔτ᾽ ἀγαθά.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly striking in this appeal of
Protagoras to his whole past life, as rendering it impossible for
him to admit what he evidently looked upon as a <i>base theory</i>, as
Stallbaum pronounces it to be. Yet the latter actually ventures to
take it away from Sokratês, who not only propounds it confidently,
but reasons it out in a clear and forcible manner, and of fastening
it on Protagoras, who first disclaims it and then only admits it
under reserve! I deny the theory to be <i>base</i>, though I think it an
imperfect theory of ethics. But Stallbaum, who calls it so, was bound
to be doubly careful in looking into his proof before he ascribed it
to any one. What makes the case worse is, that he fastens it not only
on Protagoras, but on the sophists collectively, by that monstrous
fiction which treats them as a doctrinal sect.</p>

href="#FNanchor_610">[610]</a></span> Schleiermacher (in the
Prolegomena to his translation of the Theætetus, p. 183) represents
that Plato intended to refute Aristippus in the person of Kalliklês;
which supposition he sustains, by remarking that Aristippus affirmed
that there was <i>no such thing as justice by nature</i>, but only by
law and convention. But the affirmation of Kalliklês is the direct
contrary of that which Schleiermacher ascribes to Aristippus.
Kalliklês not only does not deny justice by nature, but affirms it in
the most direct manner,—explains what it is, that it consists in the
right of the strongest man to make use of his strength without any
regard to others,—and puts it above the justice of law and society,
in respect to authority.</p>

<p>Ritter and Brandis are yet more incorrect in their accusations
of the sophists, founded upon this same doctrine. The former says
(p. 581): “It is affirmed as a common tenet of the sophists, there
is no right by nature, but only by convention;” compare Brandis,
p. 521. The very passages to which these writers refer, as far
as they prove anything, prove the contrary of what they assert;
and Preller actually imputes the contrary tenet to the sophists
(Histor. Philosoph. c. 4, p. 130, Hamburg, 1838) with just as
little authority. Both Ritter and Brandis charge the sophists with
wickedness for this alleged tenet; for denying that there was any
right by nature, and allowing no right except by convention; a
doctrine which had been maintained before them by Archelaus (Diogen.
Laërt. ii, 16). Now Plato (Legg. x, p. 889), whom these writers
refer to, charges certain wise men—σοφοὺς ἰδιώτας τε καὶ ποιητὰς
(he does not mention sophists)—with wickedness, but on the ground
directly opposite; because <i>they did acknowledge a right by</i> nature,
<i>of greater authority than the right laid down by</i> the legislator;
and because they encouraged pupils to follow this supposed right
of nature, disobeying the law; interpreting the right of nature as
Kalliklês does in the Gorgias!</p>

<p>Teachers are thus branded as wicked men by Ritter and Brandis, for
the negative, and by Plato, if he here means the sophists, for the
affirmative doctrine.</p>

of the people, without any regard to their ultimate or durable
benefit; that they are branches of the widely-extended knack of

<p id="Footnote_616"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_616">[616]</a></span> I omitted to notice the
Dialogue of Plato entitled Euthydemus, wherein Sokratês is introduced
in conversation with the two persons called sophists, Euthydemus and
Dionysodorus, who are represented as propounding a number of verbal
quibbles, assertions of double sense, arising from equivocal grammar
or syntax,—fallacies of mere diction, without the least plausibility
as to the sense,—specimens of jests and hoax, p. 278, B. They are
described as extravagantly conceited, while Sokratês is painted with
his usual affectation of deference and modesty. He himself, during a
part of the dialogue, carries on conversation in his own dialectical
manner with the youthful Kleinias; who is then handed over to be
taught by Euthydemus and Dionysodorus; so that the contrast between
their style of questioning, and that of Sokratês, is forcibly brought
out.</p>

<p>To bring out this contrast, appears to me the main purpose of the
dialogue, as has already been remarked by Socher and others (see
Stallbaum, Prolegom. ad Euthydem. pp. 15-65): but its construction,
its manner, and its result, previous to the concluding conversation
between Sokratês and Kriton separately, is so thoroughly comic, that
Ast, on this and other grounds, rejects it as spurious and unworthy
of Plato (see Ast, über Platons Leben und Schriften, pp. 414-418).</p>

<p>Without agreeing in Ast’s inference, I recognize the violence of
the caricature which Plato has here presented under the characters of
Euthydemus and Dionysodorus. And it is for this reason, among many
others, that I protest the more emphatically against the injustice
of Stallbaum and the commentators generally, who consider these two
persons as disciples of Protagoras, and samples of what is called
“Sophistica,” the sophistical practice, the sophists generally. There
is not the smallest ground for considering these two men as disciples
of Protagoras, who is presented to us, even by Plato himself, under
an aspect as totally different from them as it is possible to
imagine. Euthydemus and Dionysodorus are described, by Plato himself
in this very dialogue, as old men who had been fencing-masters, and
who had only within the last two years applied themselves to the
eristic or controversial dialogue (Euthyd. c. 1, p. 272, C.; c. 3, p.
273, E). Schleiermacher himself accounts their personal importance
so mean, that he thinks Plato could not have intended to attack
them, but meant to attack Antisthenês and the Megaric school of
philosophers (Prolegom. ad Euthydem. vol. iii, pp. 403, 404, of his
translation of Plato). So contemptible does Plato esteem them, that
Krito blames Sokratês for having so far degraded himself as to be
seen talking with them before many persons (p. 305, B, c. 30).</p>

<p>The name of Protagoras occurs only once in the dialogue, in
reference to the doctrine, started by Euthydemus, that false
propositions or contradictory propositions were impossible, because
no one could either think about or talk about <i>that which was not</i>,
or <i>the non-existent</i> (p. 284, A; 286, C). This doctrine is said
by Sokratês to have been much talked of “by Protagoras, and by men
yet earlier than he.” It is idle to infer from such a passage, any
connection or analogy between these men and Protagoras, as Stallbaum
labors to do throughout his Prolegomena; affirming (in his note on p.
286, C,) most incorrectly, that Protagoras maintained this doctrine
about τὸ μὴ ὂν, or the non-existent, because he had <i>too great faith</i>
in the evidence of the senses; whereas we know from Plato that it
had its rise with Parmenidês, who rejected the evidence of the
senses entirely (see Plato, Sophist. 24, p. 237, A, with Heindorf
and Stallbaum’s notes). Diogenes Laërtius (ix, 8, 53) falsely
asserts that Protagoras was the <i>first</i> to broach the doctrine, and
even cites as his witness Plato in the Euthydemus, where the exact
contrary is stated. Whoever broached it first, it was a doctrine
following plausibly from the then received Realism, and Plato was
long perplexed before he could solve the difficulty to his own
satisfaction (Theætet. p. 187, D).</p>

<p>I do not doubt that there were in Athens persons who abused the
dialectical exercise for frivolous puzzles, and it was well for Plato
to compose a dialogue exhibiting the contrast between these men and
Sokratês. But to treat Euthydemus and Dionysodorus as samples of “The
Sophists,” is altogether unwarranted.</p>

alludes to several such biographers, or collectors of anecdotes
about Sokratês. Yet it would seem that most of these <i>Socratici
viri</i> (Cicer. ad Attic. xiv, 9, 1) did not collect anecdotes or
conversations of the master, after the manner of Xenophon; but
composed dialogues, manifesting more or less of his method and
ἦθος, after the type of Plato. Simon the leather-cutter, however,
took memoranda of conversations held by Sokratês in his shop, and
published several dialogues purporting to be such. (Diog. Laërt. ii,
123.) The <i>Socratici viri</i> are generally praised by Cicero (Tus. D.
ii, 3, 8) for the elegance of their style.</p>

speaks always of the companions of Sokratês, not of his <i>disciples</i>:
οἱ συνόντες αὐτῷ—οἱ συνουσίασται (i, 6, 1)—οἱ συνδιατρίβοντες—οἱ
συγγιγνόμενοι—οἱ ἑταῖροι—οἱ ὁμιλοῦντες αὐτῷ—οἱ συνήθεις (iv, 8, 2)—οἱ
μεθ᾽ αὐτοῦ (iv, 2, 1)—οἱ ἐπιθύμηται (i, 2, 60). Aristippus also, in
speaking to Plato, talked of Sokratês as ὁ ἑταῖρος ἡμῶν; Aristot.
Rhetor. ii. 24. His enemies spoke of his <i>disciples</i>, in an invidious
sense; Plato, Ap. Sok. c. 21, p. 33, A.</p>

<p>It is not to be believed that any companions can have made
frequent visits, either from Megara and Thebes, to Sokratês at
Athens, during the last years of the war, before the capture of
Athens in 404 <small>B.C.</small> And in point of fact,
the passage of the Platonic Theætetus represents Eukleidês of Megara
as alluding to his conversations with Sokratês only a short time
before the death of the latter (Plato, Theætetus. c. 2. p. 142,
E). The story given by Aulus Gellius—that Eukleidês came to visit
Sokratês by night, in women’s clothes, from Megara to Athens—seems
to me an absurdity, though Deycks (De Megaricarum Doctrinâ, p. 5) is
inclined to believe it.</p>

<p id="Footnote_648"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_648">[648]</a></span> See the conversation of
Sokratês (reported by Xenophon, Mem. i, 4, 15) with Aristodemus,
respecting the gods: “What <i>will</i> be sufficient to persuade you (asks
Sokratês) that the gods care about you?” “When they <i>send me special
monitors, as you say that they do to you</i> (replies Aristodemus); to
tell me what to do, and what not to do.” To which Sokratês replied,
that they answer the questions of the Athenians, by replies of the
oracle, and that they send prodigies (τέρατα) by way of information
to the Greeks generally. He further advises Aristodemus to pay
assiduous court (θεραπεύειν) to the gods, in order to see whether
they will not send him monitory information about doubtful events (i,
4, 18).</p>

<p>So again in his conversation with Euthydemus, the latter says
to him: Σοὶ δὲ, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐοίκασιν <em class="gesperrt">ἔτι
φιλικώτερον ἢ τοῖς ἄλλοις χρῆσθαι</em>, οἵγε μηδὲ ἐπερωτώμενοι ὑπὸ

communication and advice from the gods is employed as an evidence to
prove the superior piety of Sokratês.</p>

<p>He goes on to infer that his line of defence has been right, and
that his condemnation is no misfortune to him, but a benefit, seeing
that the sign has not manifested itself.</p>

<p>I agree in the opinion of Schleiermacher (in his Preface to his
translation of the Apology of Sokratês, part i, vol. ii, p. 185, of
his general translation of Plato’s works), that this defence may be
reasonably taken as a reproduction by Plato of what Sokratês actually
said to the dikasts on his trial. In addition to the reasons given by
Schleiermacher there is one which may be noticed. Sokratês predicts
to the dikasts that, if they put him to death, a great number of
young men will forthwith put themselves forward to take up the
vocation of cross-questioning, who will give them more trouble than
he has ever done (Plat. Ap. Sok. c. 30, p. 39, D). Now there is no
reason to believe that this prediction was realized. If, therefore,
Plato puts an erroneous prophecy into the mouth of Sokratês, this is
probably because Sokratês really made one.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_650"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_650">[650]</a></span> The words of Sokratês plainly
indicate this meaning: see also a good note of Schleiermacher,

<p>The passage in the Euthyphron (c. 2, p. 3, B) is somewhat less
specific. The Pseudo-Platonic dialogue, Theagês, retains the strictly
prohibitory attribute of the voice, as never in any case impelling;
but extends the range of the warning, as if it was heard in cases not
simply personal to Sokratês himself, but referring to the conduct of
his friends also (Theagês, c. 11, 12, pp. 128, 129).</p>

<p>Xenophon also neglects the specific attributes, and conceives the
voice generally as a divine communication with instruction and advice
to Sokratês, so that he often prophesied to his friends, and was
always right (Memor. i, 1, 2-4; iv, 8, 1).</p>

<p>Ritter (Gesch. der Philos. vol, ii, ch. 2, p. 19) calls in
question the assertion that Sokratês received instruction from
Archelaus; in my judgment, without the least reason, since Ion of
Chios is a good contemporary witness. He even denies that Sokratês
received any instruction in philosophy at all, on the authority of a
passage in the Symposion of Xenophon, where Sokratês is made to speak
of himself as ἡμᾶς δὲ ὁρᾶς αὐτουργούς τινας τῆς φιλοσοφίας ὄντας (1,
5). But it appears to me that that expression implies nothing more
than a sneering antithesis, so frequent both in Plato and Xenophon,
with the costly lessons given by Protagoras, Gorgias, and Prodikus.
It cannot be understood to deny instruction given to Sokratês in the
earlier portion of his life.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_669"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_669">[669]</a></span> I think that the expression in
Plato’s Phædo, c. 102, p. 96, A, applies to Sokratês himself, and not
to Plato: τὰ γε ἐμὰ πάθη, means the mental tendencies of Sokratês
when a young man.</p>

<p>Respecting the physical studies probably sought and cultivated
by Sokratês in the earlier years of his life, see the instructive
Dissertation of Tychsen, Ueber den Prozess des Sokratês, in the
Bibliothek der Alten Literatur und Kunst; Erstes Stück, p. 43.</p>

<p>Whether Sokratês can be properly said to have been the pupil
of Anaxagoras and Archelaus, is a question of little moment,
which hardly merited the skepticism of Bayle (Anaxagoras, note R;
Archelaus, note A: compare Schanbach, Anaxagoræ Fragmenta, pp. 23,
27). That he would seek to acquaint himself with their doctrines,
and improve himself by communicating personally with them, is a
matter so probable, that the slenderest testimony suffices to make us
believe it. Moreover, as I have before remarked, we have here a good
contemporary witness, Ion of Chios, to the fact of his intimacy with
Archelaus. In no other sense than this could a man like Sokratês be
said to be the <i>pupil</i> of any one.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_689"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_689">[689]</a></span> This same tendency, to
break off from the vague aggregate then conceived as physics, is
discernible in the Hippokratic treatises, and even in the treatise
De Antiquâ Medicinâ, which M. Littré places first in his edition,
and considers to be the production of Hippokratês himself, in which
case it would be contemporary with Sokratês. On this subject of
authorship, however, other critics do not agree with him: see the
question examined in his vol. i, ch. xii, p. 295, <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>Hippokratês, if he be the author, begins by deprecating
the attempt to connect the study of medicine with physical or
astronomical hypothesis (c. 2), and he farther protests against the
procedure of various medical writers and sophists, or philosophers,
such as Empedoklês, who set themselves to make out “what man was from
the beginning, how he began first to exist, and in what manner he was
constructed,” (c. 20). This does not belong, he says, to medicine,
which ought indeed to be studied as a comprehensive whole, but as a
whole determined by and bearing reference to its own end: “You ought
to study the nature of man; what he is with reference to that which
he eats and drinks, and to all his other occupations or habits, and
to the consequences resulting from each:” ὅ,τί ἐστὶν ἄνθρωπος πρὸς τὰ
ἐσθιόμενα καὶ πινόμενα, καὶ ὅ,τι πρὸς τὰ ἄλλα ἐπιτηδεύματα, καὶ ὅ,τι
ἀφ᾽ ἑκάστου ἑκάστῳ συμβήσεται.</p>

<p>The spirit, in which Hippokratês here approaches the study of
medicine, is exceedingly analogous to that which dictated the
innovation of Sokratês in respect to the study of ethics. The same
character pervades the treatise, De Aëre, Locis et Aquis, a definite
and predetermined field of inquiry, and the Hippokratic treatises
generally.</p>

ἐπραγματεύθησαν (Metaphys. i, 5, 29, p. 986, B). But we see by
comparing two other passages in that treatise (xiii, 4, 6, p.
1078, b, with i, 5, 2, p. 985, b) that the Pythagorean definitions
of καιρὸς, τὸ δίκαιον, etc., were nothing more than certain
numerical fancies; so that these words cannot fairly be said to
have designated, in their view, logical <i>genera</i>. Nor can the
ten Pythagorean συστοιχίαι, or parallel series of contraries, be
called by that name; arranged in order to gratify a fancy about the
perfection of the number ten, which fancy afterwards seems to have
passed to Aristotle himself, when drawing up his ten predicaments.</p>

Plato, Theætet. c. 11, p. 146, D. It is maintained by Brandis, and in
part by C. Heyder (see Heyder, Kritische Darstellung und Vergleichung
der Aristotelischen und Hegelschen Dialektik, part i, pp. 85, 129),
that the logical process, called division, is not to be considered as
having been employed by Sokratês along with definition, but begins
with Plato: in proof of which they remark that, in the two Platonic
dialogues called Sophistês and Politicus, wherein this process is
most abundantly employed, Sokratês is not the conductor of the
conversation.</p>

<p>Little stress is to be laid on this circumstance, I think; and the
terms in which Xenophon describes the method of Sokratês (διαλέγοντας
κατὰ γένη τὰ πράγματα, Mem. iv, 5, 12) seem to imply the one process
as well as the other: indeed, it was scarcely possible to keep them
apart, with so abundant a talker as Sokratês. Plato doubtless both
enlarged and systematized the method in every way, and especially
made greater use of the process of division, because he pushed the
dialogue further into positive scientific research than Sokratês.</p>

Plutarch ascribes to Sokratês, Quæstiones Platonicæ, p. 999, E;
compare also Tennemann, Geschicht. der Philos. part ii, art. i, vol.
ii, p. 81.</p>

<p>Amidst the customary outpouring of groundless censure against the
sophists, which Tennemann here gives, one assertion is remarkable.
He tells us that it was the more easy for Sokratês to put down the
sophists, since their shallowness and worthlessness, after a short
period of vogue, had already been detected by intelligent men, and
was becoming discredited.</p>

<p>It is strange to find such an assertion made, for a period between
420-399 <small>B.C.</small>, the era when Protagoras,
Prodikus, Hippias, etc., reached the maximum of celebrity.</p>

<p>And what are we to say about the statement, that Sokratês put
down the sophists, when we recollect that the Megaric school and
Antisthenês, both emanating from Sokratês, are more frequently
attacked than any one else in the dialogues of Plato, as having all
those skeptical and disputatious propensities with which the sophists

knowledge, first in the statesmen, next in the poets, lastly in the
artisans and craftsmen, finds satisfaction only in the answers which
these latter made to him on matters concerning their respective
trades or professions. They would have been wise men, had it not been

καὶ τὸ ὅλον ἀνθρώποις τε καὶ τοῖς ἀνθρωπίνοις πράγμασιν εὖ χρῆσθαι.
Τοὺς γὰρ τοιούτους ἡγεῖτο παιδευθέντας οὐκ ἂν μόνον αὐτούς τε

<p>Ib. iii, 8, 3, 4, 5; iv, 6, 8. He explains τὸ ἀγαθὸν to mean τὸ
ὠφέλιμον—μέχρι δὲ τοῦ ὠφελίμου πάντα καὶ αὐτὸς συνεπεσκόπει καὶ
συνδιεξῄει τοῖς συνοῦσι (iv, 7, 8). Compare Plato, Gorgias, c. 66,
67, p. 474, D; 475, A.</p>

<p>Things are called ἀγαθὰ καὶ καλὰ on the one hand, and κακὰ καὶ
αἰσχρὰ on the other, in reference each to its distinct end, of
averting or mitigating in the one case, of bringing on or increasing
in the other, different modes of human suffering. So again, iii, 9,
4, we find the phrases: ἃ δεῖ πράττειν—ὀρθῶς πράττειν—τὰ συμφορώτατα
αὑτοῖς πράττειν, all used as equivalents.</p>

compare Plato, Republic, vi, p. 504, E. The fact that this dialogue,
called Alkibiadês II, was considered by some as belonging not to
Plato, but to Xenophon or Æschinês Socraticus, does not detract from
its value as evidence about the speculations of Sokratês (see Diogen.
Laërt. ii, 61, 62; Athenæus, v, p. 220).</p>

<p>Plato, Apol. Sok. c. 17, p. 30, A. οὐδὲν γὰρ ἄλλο πράττων

<p>Zeller (Die Philosophie der Griechen, vol. ii, pp. 61-64) admits
as a fact this reference of the Sokratic ethics to human security and
happiness as their end; while Brandis (Gesch. der Gr. Röm. Philosoph.
ii, p. 40, <i>seq.</i>) resorts to inadmissible suppositions, in order
to avoid admitting it, and to explain away the direct testimony of
Xenophon. Both of these authors consider this doctrine as a great
taint in the philosophical character of Sokratês. Zeller even says,
what he intends for strong censure, that “the eudæmonistic basis of
the Sokratic ethics differs from the <i>sophistical moral philosophy</i>,
not in principle, but only in result” (p. 61).</p>

<p>I protest against this allusion to a <i>sophistical moral
philosophy</i>, and have shown my grounds for the protest in the
preceding chapter. There was no such thing as <i>sophistical moral
philosophy</i>. Not only the sophists were no sect or school, but
farther, not one of them ever aimed, so far as we know, at
establishing any ethical theory: this was the great innovation of
Sokratês. But it is perfectly true that, between the preceptorial
exhortation of Sokratês, and that of Protagoras or Prodikus, there
was no great or material difference; and this Zeller seems to
admit.</p>

aphorisms of the emperor Marcus Antoninus, vi, 35: Οὐχ ὁρᾷς, πῶς οἱ

Sokratês, in the same manner, treats this same mental infirmity as
being near to madness, and distinguishes it carefully from simple
want of knowledge, or conscious ignorance: Μανίαν γε μὴν ἐναντίον μὲν
ἔφη εἶναι σοφίᾳ, οὐ μέντοι γε τὴν ἀνεπιστημοσύνην μανίαν ἐνόμιζεν.

from it, is not less powerfully attested in the simpler language
of Xenophon, than in the metaphorical variety of Plato. See the
conversation with Euthydêmus, in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, iv,
2; a long dialogue which ends by the confession of the latter (c.
39): Ἀναγκάζει με καὶ ταῦτα ὁμολογεῖν δηλονότι ἡ ἐμὴ φαυλότης· καὶ

<p>This same expression, “thinking himself no better than a
slave,” is also put by Plato into the mouth of Alkibiadês, when
he is describing the powerful effect wrought on his mind by the
conversation of Sokratês (Symposion, c. 39, p. 215, 216): Περικλέους

various passages of the immortal criticisms in the Novum Organon.
When Sokratês, as Xenophon tells us, devoted his time to questioning
others: “What is piety? What is justice? What is temperance, courage,
political government?” etc., we best understand the spirit of his
procedure by comparing the sentence which Bacon pronounces upon the
<i>first notions of the intellect,—as radically vicious, confused,
badly abstracted from things, and needing complete reexamination
and revision</i>,—without which, he says, not one of them could be
trusted:—</p>

<p>“Quod vero attinet ad notiones primas intellectûs, nihil est
<i>eorum, quas intellectus sibi permissus congessit, quin nobis pro
suspecto sit</i>, nec ullo modo ratum nisi novo judicio se stiterit, et
secundum illud pronuntiatum fuerit.” (Distributio Operis, prefixed
to the N. O. p. 168, of Mr. Montagu’s edition.) “Serum sane rebus
perditis adhibetur remedium, postquam mens ex quotidianâ vitæ
consuetudine, et auditionibus, et doctrinis inquinatis occupata, et
vanissimis idolis obsessa fuerit.... Restat unica salus ac sanitas,
ut <i>opus mentis universum de integro resumatur; ac mens, jam ab ipso
principio, nullo modo sibi permittatur</i>, sed perpetuo regatur.”
(Ib. Præfatio, p. 186.) “Syllogismus ex propositionibus constat,
propositiones ex verbis, verba notionum tesseræ sunt. Itaque si
notiones ipsæ (id quod basis rei est) confusæ sint et temere a rebus
abstractæ, nihil in iis quæ superstruuntur est firmitudinis. Itaque
spes est una in inductione verâ. <i>In notionibus nihil sani est</i>, nec
in logicis, nec in physicis. <i>Non Substantia, non Qualitas, Agere,
Pati, ipsum Esse, bonæ, notiones sunt;</i> multo minus Grave, Leve,
Der sum, Tenue, Humidum, Siccum, Generatio, Corruptio, Attrahere,
Fugare, Elementum, Materia, Forma, et id Genus; sed omnes phantasticæ
et male terminatæ. Notiones infimarum specierum, Hominis, Canis, et
prehensionum immediatarum sensus, Albi, Nigri, non fallunt magnopere:
<i>reliquæ omnes (quibus homines hactenus usi sunt) aberrationes sunt</i>,
nec debitis modis a rebus abstractæ et excitatæ.” (Aphor. 14, 15,
16.) “Nemo adhuc tantâ mentis constantiâ et rigore inventus est, ut
decreverit et sibi imposuerit, <i>theorias et notiones communes penitus
abolere, et intellectum abrasum et æquum ad particularia de integro
applicare. Itaque ratio illa quam habemus, ex multâ fide et multo
etiam casu, necnon ex puerilibus, quas primo hausimus, notionibus,
farrago quædam est et congeries</i>.” (Aphor. 97.) “Nil magis
philosophiæ offecisse deprehendimus, quam quod res quæ familiares
sunt et frequenter occurrunt, contemplationem hominum non morentur et
detineant, sed recipiantur obiter, neque earum causæ quasi soleant;
ut non sæpius requiratur informatio de rebus ignotis, quam attentio
in notis.” (Aphor. 119.)</p>

<p>These passages, and many others to the same effect which might be
extracted from the Novum Organon, afford a clear illustration and
an interesting parallel to the spirit and purpose of Sokratês. He
sought to test the fundamental notions and generalizations respecting
man and society, in the same spirit in which Bacon approached those
of physics: he suspected the unconscious process of the growing
intellect, and desired to revise it, by comparison with particulars;
and from particulars too the most clear and certain, but which, from
being of vulgar occurrence, were least attended to. And that which
Sokratês described in his language as “conceit of knowledge without
the reality,” is identical with what Bacon designates as the <i>primary
notions</i>, the <i>puerile notions</i>, the <i>aberrations</i>, of the intellect
left to itself, which have become so familiar and appear so certainly
known, that the mind cannot shake them off, and has lost all habit,
we might almost say all power, of examining them.</p>

<p>The stringent process—or electric shock, to use the simile in
Plato’s Menon—of the Sokratic elenchus, afforded the best means
of resuscitating this lost power. And the manner in which Plato
speaks of this cross-examining elenchus, as “the great and sovereign
purification, without which every man, be he the great king himself,
is unschooled, dirty, and fall of uncleanness in respect to the main
conditions of happiness,”—καὶ τὸν ἔλεγχον λεκτέον ὡς ἄρα μεγίστη καὶ
κυριωτάτη τῶν καθάρσεων ἐστὶ, καὶ τὸν ἀνέλεγκτον αὖ νομιστέον, ἂν
καὶ τυγχάνῃ μέγας βασιλεὺς ὤν, τὰ μέγιστα ἀκάθαρτον ὄντα· ἀπαίδευτόν
τε καὶ αἰσχρὸν γεγονέναι ταῦτα, ἃ καθαρώτατον καὶ κάλλιστον ἔπρεπε
τὸν ὄντως ἐσόμενον εὐδαίμονα εἶναι; Plato, Sophist. c. 34, p. 230,
E,—precisely corresponds to that “<i>cross-examination of human reason
in its native or spontaneous process</i>,” which Bacon specifies as one
of the three things essential to the expurgation of the intellect, so
as to qualify it for the attainment of truth: “Itaque doctrina ista
de expurgatione intellectûs, ut ipse ad veritatem habilis sit, tribus
redargutionibus absolvitur; redargutione philosophiarum, redargutione
demonstrationum, et <i>redargutione rationis humanæ nativæ</i>.” (Nov.
Organ. Distributio Operis, p. 170, ed. Montagu.)</p>

<p>To show further how essential it is in the opinion of the best
judges, that the native intellect should be purged or purified,
before it can properly apprehend the truths of physical philosophy,
I transcribe the introductory passage of Sir John Herschel’s
“Astronomy:”—</p>

<p>“In entering upon any scientific pursuit, one of the student’s
first endeavors ought to be to prepare his mind for the reception
of truth, by dismissing, or at least loosening his hold on, all
such crude and hastily adopted notions respecting the objects and
relations he is about to examine, as may tend to embarrass or mislead
him; and to strengthen himself, by <i>something of an effort and a
resolve</i>, for the unprejudiced admission of any conclusion which
shall appear to be supported by careful observation and logical
argument; even should it prove adverse to notions he may have
previously formed for himself, or taken up, without examination on
the credit of others. <i>Such an effort is, in fact, a commencement of
that intellectual discipline which forms one of the most important
ends of all science.</i> It is the first movement of approach towards
that state of mental purity which alone can fit us for a full and
steady perception of moral beauty as well as physical adaptation. It
is the “euphrasy and rue,” with <i>which we must purge our sight before
we can receive, and contemplate as they are, the lineaments of truth
and nature</i>.” (Sir John Herschel, Astronomy; Introduction.)</p>

<p>I could easily multiply citations from other eminent writers on
physical philosophy, to the same purpose. All of them prescribe this
intellectual purification: Sokratês not only prescribed it, but
actually administered it, by means of his elenchus, in reference to
the subjects on which he talked.</p>

<p id="Footnote_734"><span class="label"><a

Novum Organon (Aph. 71):—</p>

<p>“Erat autem sapientia Græcorum professoria, et in disputationes
effusa, quod genus inquisitioni veritatis adversissimum est.
Itaque nomen illud Sophistarum—quod per contemptum ab iis, qui se
philosophos haberi voluerunt, in antiquos rhetores rejectum et
traductum est, Gorgiam, Protagoram, Hippiam, Polum—etiam universo
generi competit, Platoni, Aristoteli, Zenoni, Epicuro, Theophrasto,
et eorum successoribus, Chrysippo, Carneadi, reliquis.”</p>

<p>Bacon is quite right in effacing the distinction between the two
lists of persons whom he compares; and in saying that the latter
were just as much sophists as the former, in the sense which he here
gives to the word, as well as in every other legitimate sense. But
he is not justified in imputing to either of them this many-sided
argumentation as a fault, looking to the subjects upon which they
brought it to bear. His remark has application to the simpler
physical sciences, but none to the moral. It had great pertinence and
value, at the time when he brought it forward, and with reference
to the important reforms which he was seeking to accomplish in
physical science. In so far as Plato, Aristotle, or the other Greek
philosophers, apply their deductive method to physical subjects,
they come justly under Bacon’s censure. But here again, the fault
consisted less in disputing too much, than in too hastily admitting
false or inaccurate axioms without dispute.</p>

<p>The indispensable necessity, to a philosopher, of having before
him all the difficulties and doubts of the problem which he tries
to solve, and of looking at a philosophical question with the
same alternate attention to its affirmative and negative side, as
is shown by a judge to two litigants, is strikingly set forth in
this passage. I transcribes portion of it: Ἐστὶ δὲ τοῖς εὐπορῆσαι
βουλομένοις προὔργου τὸ διαπορῆσαι καλῶς· ἡ γὰρ ὕστερον εὐπορία λύσις
τῶν πρότερον ἀπορουμένων ἐστὶ, λύειν δ᾽ οὐκ ἐστιν ἀγνοοῦντας τὸν
δεσμόν.... Διὸ δεῖ τὰς δυσχερείας τεθεωρηκέναι πάσας πρότερον, τούτων
τε χάριν, καὶ διὰ τὸ τοὺς ζητοῦντας ἄνευ τοῦ διαπορῆσαι πρῶτον,
ὁμοίους εἶναι τοῖς ποῖ δεῖ βαδίζειν ἀγνοοῦσι, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις οὐδ᾽
εἴ ποτε τὸ ζητούμενον εὕρηκεν, ἢ μὴ, γιγνώσκειν· τὸ γὰρ τέλος τούτῳ
μὲν οὐ δῆλον, τῷ δὲ προηπορηκότι δῆλον. Ἔτι δὲ βέλτιον ἀνάγκη ἔχειν
πρὸς τὸ κρίνειν, τὸν ὥσπερ ἀντιδίκων καὶ τῶν ἀμφισβητούντων λόγων
ἀκηκοότα πάντων.</p>

<p>A little further on, in the same chapter (iii, 1, 19, p. 996,
<i>a</i>), he makes a remarkable observation. Not merely it is difficult,
on these philosophical subjects, to get at the truth, but it is not
easy to perform well even the preliminary task of discerning and
setting forth the ratiocinative difficulties which are to be dealt
with: Περὶ γὰρ τούτων ἁπάντων οὐ μόνον χαλεπὸν τὸ εὐπορῆσαι τῆς
ἀληθείας, ἀλλ᾽ <em class="gesperrt">οὐδὲ τὸ διαπορῆσαι τῷ λόγῳ ῥᾴδιον
καλῶς</em>. Διαπορῆσαι means the same as διεξελθεῖν τὰς ἀπορίας
(Bonitz. not. <i>ad loc.</i>), “to go through the various points of
difficulty.”</p>

<p>This last passage illustrates well the characteristic gift of
Sokratês, which was exactly what Aristotle calls τὸ διαπορῆσαι λόγῳ
καλῶς; to force on the hearer’s mind those ratiocinative difficulties
which served both as spur and as guide towards solution and positive
truth; towards comprehensive and correct generalization, with clear
consciousness of the common attribute binding together the various
particulars included.</p>

<p>The same care to admit and even invite the development of the
negative side of a question, to accept the obligation of grappling
with all the difficulties, to assimilate the process of inquiry to
a judicial pleading, is to be seen in other passages of Aristotle;
see Ethic. Nikomach. vii, 1, 5; De Animâ, i, 2. p. 403, <i>b</i>; De
Cœlo, i, 10, p. 279, <i>b</i>; Topica, i, 2, p. 101, <i>a</i>: (Χρήσιμος δὲ ἡ
διαλεκτικὴ) πρὸς τὰς κατὰ φιλοσοφίαν ἐπιστήμας, ὅτι δυνάμενοι πρὸς
ἀμφότερα διαπορῆσαι, ῥᾷον ἐν ἑκάστοις κατοψόμεθα τἀληθές τε καὶ τὸ
ψεῦδος. Compare also Cicero, Tusc. Disput. ii, 3, 9.</p>

disputandi, rerumque varietas, et ingenii magnitudo, Platonis
ingenio et literis consecrata, plura genera effecit dissentientium

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_737"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_737">[737]</a></span> In setting forth the ethical
end, the language of Sokratês, as far as we can judge from Xenophon
and Plato, seems to have been not always consistent with itself. He
sometimes stated it as if it included a reference to the happiness,
not merely of the agent himself, but of others besides; both as
coördinate elements; at other times, he seems to speak as if the end
was nothing more than the happiness of the agent himself, though the
happiness of others was among the greatest and most essential means.
The former view is rather countenanced by Xenophon, the best witness
about his master, so that I have given it as belonging to Sokratês,
though it is not always adhered to. The latter view appears most in
Plato, who assimilates the health of the soul to the health of the
body, an end essentially self-regarding.</p>

To call him the juster man of the two, when neither are just, can
hardly be meant: I translate it according to what seems to me the
meaning intended. So γραμματικώτερον, in the sentence before, means,
comes nearer to a good orthographer. The Greek derivative adjectives
in -ικὸς are very difficult to render precisely.</p>

<p>Compare Plato, Hippias Minor, c. 15, p. 372, D, where the same
opinion is maintained. Hippias tells Sokratês, in that dialogue (c.
11, p. 369, B), that he fixes his mind on a part of the truth, and
omits to notice the rest.</p>

δ᾽ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἀρεταὶ λέγονται ταύτας πάσας σκοπούμενος εὑρήσεις
μαθήσει τε καὶ <em class="gesperrt">μελέτῃ</em> αὐξανομένας. Again,
the necessity of practise or discipline is inculcated, iii, 9, 1.
When Sokratês enumerates the qualities requisite in a good friend,
it is not merely superior knowledge which he talks of, but of moral
excellence; continence, a self-sufficing temper, mildness, a grateful
disposition (c. ii, 6, 1-5).</p>

<p>Moreover, Sokratês laid it down that continence, or self-control,
was the very basis of virtue: τὴν ἐγκράτειαν ἀρετῆς κρηπῖδα (i, 5,
4). Also, that <i>continence</i> was indispensable in order to enable a
man to acquire knowledge (iv, 5, 10, 11).</p>

<p>Sokratês here plainly treats ἐγκράτειαν (continence, or
self-control) as not being a state of the intellectual man, and yet
as being the very basis of virtue. He therefore does not seem to have
applied consistently his general doctrine, that virtue consisted
in knowledge, or in the excellence of the intellectual man, alone.
Perhaps he might have said: Knowledge alone will be sufficient to
make you virtuous; but before you can acquire knowledge, you must
previously have disciplined your emotions and appetites. This merely
eludes the objection, without saving the sufficiency of the general
doctrine.</p>

<p>I cannot concur with Ritter (Gesch. der Philos. vol. ii, ch. 2,
p. 78) in thinking that Sokratês meant by <i>knowledge</i>, or <i>wisdom</i>,
a transcendental attribute, above humanity, and such as is possessed
only by a god. This is by no means consistent with that practical
conception of human life and its ends, which stands so plainly marked
in his character.</p>

<p>Why should we think it wonderful that Sokratês should propose
a defective theory, which embraces only one side of a large and
complicated question? Considering that his was the first theory
derived from data really belonging to the subject, the wonder is,
that it was so near an approach to the truth.</p>

36, A; Diog. Laërt. ii, 41. Diogenes says that he was condemned by
two hundred and eighty-one ψήφοις πλείοσι τῶν ἀπολυούσων. If he
meant to assert that the verdict was found by a <i>majority</i> of two
hundred and eighty-one above the acquitting votes, this would be
contradicted by the “Platonic Apology,” which assures us beyond any
doubt that the majority was not greater than five or six, so that
the turning of three votes would have altered the verdict. But as
the number two hundred and eighty-one seems precise, and is not in
itself untrustworthy, some commentators construe it, though the words
as they now stand are perplexing, as the aggregate of the majority.
Since the “Platonic Apology” proves that it was a majority of five or
six, the minority would consequently be two hundred and seventy-six,
and the total five hundred and fifty-seven.</p>

12, 44. “Cum Zenone Arcesilas sibi omne certamen instituit, non
pertinaciâ aut studio vincendi (ut mihi quidem videtur), sed earum
rerum obscuritate, quæ ad confessionem ignorationis adduxerant
Socratem, et jam ante Socratem, Democritum, Anaxagoram, Empedoclem,
omnes pene veteres; qui nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri,
posse, dixerunt.... Itaque Arcesilas negabat, esse quidquam, quod
sciri posset, no illud quidem ipsum, quod Socrates sibi reliquisset:
sic omnia latere in occulto.” Compare Academ. Prior. ii, 23, 74; de
Nat. Deor. i, 5, 11.</p>

<p>In another passage (Academ. Post. i, 4, 17) Cicero speaks (or
rather introduces Varro as speaking) rather confusedly. He talks
of “illam Socraticam dubitationem de omnibus rebus, et nullâ
affirmatione adhibitâ, consuetudinem disserendi;” but a few lines
before, he had said what implies that men might, in the opinion of
Sokratês, come to learn and know what belonged to human conduct and
human duties.</p>

<p>Again (in Tusc. Disp. i, 4, 8), he admits that Sokratês had
a positive ulterior purpose in his negative questioning: “vetus
et Socratica ratio contra alterius opinionem disserendi: nam ita
facillime, quid veri simillimum esset, inveniri posse Socrates
arbitrabatur.”</p>

<p>Tennemann (Gesch. der Philos. ii, 5, vol. ii, pp. 169-175) seeks
to make out considerable analogy between Sokratês and Pyrrho. But it
seems to me that the analogy only goes thus far, that both agreed in
repudiating all speculations not ethical (see the verses of Timon
upon Pyrrho, Diog. Laërt. ix, 65). But in regard to ethics, the two
differed materially. Sokratês maintained that ethics were matter
of science, and the proper subject of study. Pyrrho, on the other
hand, seems to have thought that speculation was just as useless,
and science just as unattainable, upon ethics as upon physics; that
nothing was to be attended to except feelings, and nothing cultivated
except good dispositions.</p>

Lysand. c. 2) among those to whom he ascribes φύσιν μελανχολικὴν, the
black bile and ecstatic temperament. I do not know how to reconcile
this with a passage in his Rhetoric (ii, 17), in which he ranks
Sokratês among the <i>sedate</i> persons (στάσιμον). The first of the two
assertions seems countenanced by the anecdotes respecting Sokratês
(in Plato, Symposion, p. 175, B; p. 220, C), that he stood in the
same posture, quite unmoved, even for several hours continuously,
absorbed in meditation upon some idea which had seized his mind.</p>

his condemnation. It affords me much satisfaction to see that he
has bestowed such just animadversions on the unmeasured bitterness,
as well as upon the untenable views, of M. Forchhammer’s treatise
respecting Sokratês.</p>

<p>I dissent, however, altogether, from the manner in which Dr.
Thirlwall speaks about the sophists, both in this Appendix and
elsewhere. My opinion, respecting the persons so called, has been

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
